    "The [Amazon Textract Textractor Library](https://aws-samples.github.io/amazon-textract-textractor/index.html) is a library that seamlessly works with Textract features to aid in document processing. You can start by checking out the [examples in the documentation.](https://aws-samples.github.io/amazon-textract-textractor/notebooks/layout_analysis_for_text_linearization.html)\n",
    "This notebook utilizes the Textractor library to interact with Amazon Textract and interpret its response. It enriches the extracted document text with XML tags to delineate sections, facilitating layout-aware chunking and document indexing into a Vector Database (DB). This process aims to enhance Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) performance.\n",

    "## Background (Problem Description and Approach)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Problem statement**: \n",
    "RAG serves as a technique aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) on lengthy textual content. While widely adopted, implementing RAG necessitates initial processing to extract and segment text into meaningful chunks, especially challenging for intricate assets like PDFs. Many document parsing approaches overlook layout semantics or use simplistic methods like fixed window carving, lacking awareness of document structure or elements. This can disrupt contextual continuity and diminish the performance of RAG systems. An optimal RAG input pipeline would intelligently divide PDF texts into vectorized segments aligned with layout and content semantics, preserving informational integrity for the LLM. In essence, a context-aware parsing phase is pivotal for enabling RAG techniques to realize their full potential, particularly when handling extensive or intricate documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Our approach**: \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/txt-layout-Page-2.jpg\" width=\"800\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Upload multi-page document to Amazon S3.\n",
    "2. Call Amazon Textract Start Document Analysis api call to extract Document Text including Layout and Tables. The response provides structured text aligned with the original document formatting and the pandas tables of each table detected in the document.\n",
    "3. Enrich this extracted text further with XML tags indicating semantic sections, adding contextual metadata through the Textractor library.\n",
    "4. The textrcat library extracts tables in plain text, maintaining their original layout. However, for improved processing and manipulation, it's advisable to convert them to CSV format. This method replaces the plain text tables with their CSV counterparts obtained from Textract's table feature.\n",
    "5.  In this approach, the extracted text is segmented based on document title sections, the highest hierarchy level in a document. Each subsection within the title section is then chunked according to a maximum word threshold. Below outlines our approach to handling the chunking of subsection elements.:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Tables:** Tables are chunked row by row until the maximum number of alphanumeric words is reached. For each table chunk, the column headers are added to the table along with the table header, typically the sentence or paragraph preceding the table in the document. This ensures that the information of the table is retained in each chunk.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    <img src=\"images/table-chunkers.png\" width=\"800\" height=700/>\n",
    "    \n",
    "        To handle tables with merged cells, this solution first unmerges any merged cell ranges, then duplicates the original merged cell value into each of the corresponding individual cells after unmerging.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    <img src=\"images/complex-tables.png\" width=\"800\" height=700/>\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **List:** Chunking lists found in documents can be challenging. Naive chunking methods often split list items by sentence or newline characters. However, this approach presents issues as only the first list chunk typically contains the list title, which provides essential information about the list items. Consequently, subsequent list chunks become obsolete. In this notebook, lists are chunked based on their individual list items. Additionally, the header of the list is appended to each list chunk to ensure that the information of the list is preserved in each chunk.\n",
    "    <img src=\"images/list-chunker.png\" width=\"800\" height=700/>\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **Section and subsection:** The structure of a document can generally be categorized into titles, sections, and paragraphs. A paragraph is typically the smallest unit of a document that conveys information independently, particularly within the context of a section or subsection header. In this method, text sections are chunked based on paragraphs, and the section header is added to each paragraph chunk (as well as tables and lists) within that section of the document.\n",
    "    <img src=\"images/text-chunks.png\" width=\"800\" height=700/>\n",
    "    \n",
    "6. Metadata is appended to each respective chunk during indexing, encompassing:\n",
    "    - The entire CSV tables detected within the chunk.\n",
    "    - The section header ID associated with the chunk.\n",
    "    - The section title ID linked to the chunk.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    When retrieving a passage based on hybrid search (combining semantic and text matching), there's flexibility in the amount of content forwarded to the LLM. Some queries may necessitate additional information, allowing users to choose whether to send the corresponding chunk subsection or title section based on the specific use case.\n",
    "\n",
    " *Some chunk may exceed the fixed word count threshold due to preserving paragraphs and dealing with complex tables. \n",

      "FOREWORD\n",
      "The purpose of this manual is to serve as a guide in developing proper insurance requirements in contracts. This manual explains how to establish insurance requirements for most contracts, including those with contractors, professional service providers, tenants, vendors, and users of public property, and how to verify their compliance with those requirements during the term of the contract.\n",
      "It should be noted, however, that risk management is more of an art than a science, and therefore, although this manual will provide guidance in 90% of the cases encountered by the user, there will also be exceptions to the rules contained herein. If the user encounters situations that fall outside of the manual's recommendations, the user should contact its insurance and legal advisors.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Chunk 1:\n",
      "Recent editions have undergone extensive revisions to eliminate older insurance forms and to condense the material to make it easier for those without an insurance background to access and implement the recommendations. This includes a \"basics\" section that describes each element of the insurance requirements and provides a single set of specifications that can be used for most contracts. Instructions for the contractor and insurance agent or broker have also been included to make it easier for the contract administrator to request and receive the required coverage.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Chunk 2:\n",
      "Another major change from years past is the elimination of most of the customized forms for public agencies. One of the proposed techniques of earlier editions was to request that insurers execute certificates and endorsement forms provided by the public entity. The obvious benefit of this approach is that the public entity knows that it is receiving the coverage it is looking for if the exact endorsement is provided. However, because many insurance forms require prior approval by state regulators, many insurers refused to use custom entity-designed endorsements, and it is no longer practical to obtain them. Also, most of the terms of the insurance requirements have been incorporated within standard insurance forms, lessening the need to spell out specific requirements. Finally, the reality of the emerging cyber and aviation risks has led the editors to create separate chapters on each.\n",
      "The editors recommend that you use the specifications that spell out the form numbers and key terms described in this manual. Some insurers use custom policy documents, and we suggest that you compare the language in those documents to the specifications to verify that you are receiving the recommended coverage.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Chunk 3:\n",
      "This manual contains sample standard Insurance Service Office (ISO) industry forms for reference. Occasionally, new editions of these forms are released. These new editions may broaden coverage, but they may also restrict coverage from the previous edition. An attempt is made in each successive version of this manual to include any updated forms, as well as comments on the changes made to old editions, and recommendations on which forms to use. Though a new edition is released, insurance companies may continue to use older editions of these forms. It is, therefore, important that the user check the edition date of the form supplied by contractors, tenants, vendors, and users of public property, and/or their agents and brokers. The edition date can usually be found in the lower left-hand corner of the form, following the form number.\n",
      "This edition contains a review of significant updates to the ISO Commercial General Liability form and related Additional Insured endorsement forms, released December 2019. The impacts of some of these changes are significant and wide ranging. While every attempt is made to present these changes in a concise manner, we strongly encourage you to review with your Legal and Risk\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Chunk 4:\n",
      "Management staff the implications of these changes to your Agency and update your Contracts to \"trigger\" coverage under these new forms. Otherwise, you may have reduced or even no coverage at claim time! Non-insurance sections of the contract are also very important to the risk management process. Normally, the \"Indemnification\" and \"Scope of Work\" sections should be reviewed for unusual language or risky activities. If the contractor's insurance does not meet the requirements under the contract, it is the contractor's responsibility to obtain the necessary coverage to satisfy its agreement with your Entity.\n",
      "Insurance is only one way that the contractor can fulfill its financial responsibilities to your Entity. A section in the contract should state that the lack of insurance does not negate the contractor's obligations under the contract, such as \"These Indemnification provisions are independent of and shall not in any way be limited by the Insurance requirements of this agreement. Entity approval of the Insurance contracts required by this Agreement does not in any way relieve the Contractor from liability under this section.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Chunk 5:\n",
      "As Alliant is not a law firm, we recommend that users of this manual consult with their own insurance professionals or legal counsel for specific language for this section's wording. Make sure your indemnity language is strong, and if the contractor does not carry sufficient or correct insurance to cover its obligations to your Entity, make certain it does have the assets to indemnify the Entity for those uninsured or underinsured areas of risk.\n",
      "Finally, a section is included containing the most commonly asked questions from manual users over the years. We have included this section as a resource for the user, to illustrate that risk management is not always a simple process, and to encourage the user to contact their insurance advisor when encountering an \"outside the box\" situation.\n",

      "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n",
      "This manual originates from work performed in the late 1970's by public entity risk managers and consultants, a time when the field of public entity risk management was beginning to come into its own. The editors acknowledge the work of Erin Oberly, a risk management consultant working with Frank James of the Redwood Empire Municipal Insurance Fund (REMIF), for the earliest versions of this manual. Many changes have occurred in the fields of risk management and insurance since its inception, and this manual has kept up with those changes due to the continued support and dedication of public entity risk managers and consultants, including David Born, David Clovis, Joe Risser, Marcus Beverly, and Marjorie Segale. Over the past several years, the updates have been prepared with the support of PRISM (Public Risk Innovation, Solutions, and Management) including the expertise of Robert Marshburn of CertifiedRiskManagers.com Mr. Marshburn is a recognized leader in the field of risk management, insurance policy language and public agency contracting as well as the founder of AutomatedInsuranceVerification.com.\n",

      "FOREWORD\n",
      "The purpose of this manual is to serve as a guide in developing proper insurance requirements in contracts. This manual explains how to establish insurance requirements for most contracts, including those with contractors, professional service providers, tenants, vendors, and users of public property, and how to verify their compliance with those requirements during the term of the contract.\n",
      "It should be noted, however, that risk management is more of an art than a science, and therefore, although this manual will provide guidance in 90% of the cases encountered by the user, there will also be exceptions to the rules contained herein. If the user encounters situations that fall outside of the manual's recommendations, the user should contact its insurance and legal advisors.\n",
      "Document indexed successfully with ID: GTvFnpABZY-SBRPU5TI6\n",
      "Recent editions have undergone extensive revisions to eliminate older insurance forms and to condense the material to make it easier for those without an insurance background to access and implement the recommendations. This includes a \"basics\" section that describes each element of the insurance requirements and provides a single set of specifications that can be used for most contracts. Instructions for the contractor and insurance agent or broker have also been included to make it easier for the contract administrator to request and receive the required coverage.\n",
      "Document indexed successfully with ID: GjvFnpABZY-SBRPU5zIS\n",
      "Another major change from years past is the elimination of most of the customized forms for public agencies. One of the proposed techniques of earlier editions was to request that insurers execute certificates and endorsement forms provided by the public entity. The obvious benefit of this approach is that the public entity knows that it is receiving the coverage it is looking for if the exact endorsement is provided. However, because many insurance forms require prior approval by state regulators, many insurers refused to use custom entity-designed endorsements, and it is no longer practical to obtain them. Also, most of the terms of the insurance requirements have been incorporated within standard insurance forms, lessening the need to spell out specific requirements. Finally, the reality of the emerging cyber and aviation risks has led the editors to create separate chapters on each.\n",
      "The editors recommend that you use the specifications that spell out the form numbers and key terms described in this manual. Some insurers use custom policy documents, and we suggest that you compare the language in those documents to the specifications to verify that you are receiving the recommended coverage.\n",
      "Document indexed successfully with ID: GzvFnpABZY-SBRPU6DLn\n",
      "This manual contains sample standard Insurance Service Office (ISO) industry forms for reference. Occasionally, new editions of these forms are released. These new editions may broaden coverage, but they may also restrict coverage from the previous edition. An attempt is made in each successive version of this manual to include any updated forms, as well as comments on the changes made to old editions, and recommendations on which forms to use. Though a new edition is released, insurance companies may continue to use older editions of these forms. It is, therefore, important that the user check the edition date of the form supplied by contractors, tenants, vendors, and users of public property, and/or their agents and brokers. The edition date can usually be found in the lower left-hand corner of the form, following the form number.\n",
      "This edition contains a review of significant updates to the ISO Commercial General Liability form and related Additional Insured endorsement forms, released December 2019. The impacts of some of these changes are significant and wide ranging. While every attempt is made to present these changes in a concise manner, we strongly encourage you to review with your Legal and Risk\n",
      "Document indexed successfully with ID: HDvFnpABZY-SBRPU6jLa\n",
      "Management staff the implications of these changes to your Agency and update your Contracts to \"trigger\" coverage under these new forms. Otherwise, you may have reduced or even no coverage at claim time! Non-insurance sections of the contract are also very important to the risk management process. Normally, the \"Indemnification\" and \"Scope of Work\" sections should be reviewed for unusual language or risky activities. If the contractor's insurance does not meet the requirements under the contract, it is the contractor's responsibility to obtain the necessary coverage to satisfy its agreement with your Entity.\n",
      "Insurance is only one way that the contractor can fulfill its financial responsibilities to your Entity. A section in the contract should state that the lack of insurance does not negate the contractor's obligations under the contract, such as \"These Indemnification provisions are independent of and shall not in any way be limited by the Insurance requirements of this agreement. Entity approval of the Insurance contracts required by this Agreement does not in any way relieve the Contractor from liability under this section.\"\n",
      "Document indexed successfully with ID: HTvFnpABZY-SBRPU7DKn\n",
      "As Alliant is not a law firm, we recommend that users of this manual consult with their own insurance professionals or legal counsel for specific language for this section's wording. Make sure your indemnity language is strong, and if the contractor does not carry sufficient or correct insurance to cover its obligations to your Entity, make certain it does have the assets to indemnify the Entity for those uninsured or underinsured areas of risk.\n",
      "Finally, a section is included containing the most commonly asked questions from manual users over the years. We have included this section as a resource for the user, to illustrate that risk management is not always a simple process, and to encourage the user to contact their insurance advisor when encountering an \"outside the box\" situation.\n",

      "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n",
      "This manual originates from work performed in the late 1970's by public entity risk managers and consultants, a time when the field of public entity risk management was beginning to come into its own. The editors acknowledge the work of Erin Oberly, a risk management consultant working with Frank James of the Redwood Empire Municipal Insurance Fund (REMIF), for the earliest versions of this manual. Many changes have occurred in the fields of risk management and insurance since its inception, and this manual has kept up with those changes due to the continued support and dedication of public entity risk managers and consultants, including David Born, David Clovis, Joe Risser, Marcus Beverly, and Marjorie Segale. Over the past several years, the updates have been prepared with the support of PRISM (Public Risk Innovation, Solutions, and Management) including the expertise of Robert Marshburn of CertifiedRiskManagers.com Mr. Marshburn is a recognized leader in the field of risk management, insurance policy language and public agency contracting as well as the founder of AutomatedInsuranceVerification.com.\n",

      "The authors of this manual have performed a calculation of how a $1 million/$2 million per occurrence/annual aggregate limit compares to today's environment. Using the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the value of $1 million in 1986 (when the new CGL initiated) would be over $5 million in today's dollars. But using an inflation factor impacted by tort litigation inflation aka \"social inflation\" we estimate that the value of $1 million in 1986 is over $10 million for tort\n",

      "liability claims in today's dollars (see resources at the Insurance Information Institute at i.org and other industry references). Beyond the direct impact of increased medical costs and higher attorney's fees, a key change has been the introduction of third-party litigation funding for plaintiff litigation costs. Much information has been published on how third-party litigation funding has changed the duration and cost trajectory of claims. Plaintiffs now have the financial ability to resist pressures for early settlement at lower value. As a result, when the impacts of social inflation are combined with the availability of third-party litigation financing, the cost of liability claims has increased at a faster rate than the CPI. Appropriate minimum limits will vary based on state jurisdiction and availability of governmental immunities and tort claims caps. Keep in mind that claims brought under federal causes of action or in other state jurisdictions may have very different potential cost.\n",

      "The following questions represent those most often asked by users of this manual. If you have questions that are not answered by this section, please do not hesitate to contact your Alliant Account Administrator. As you can see by reviewing the following section, we all learn through the process of thoughtfully examining the risk management process.:\n",
      "1. If a lessee or contractor is a large one, do I still need to insist on the insurance requirements? \n",
      "Yes; you normally have no way of verifying that their assets are sufficient for losses that might occur, whereas you could be confident in an insurance carrier with a quality A.M. Best Rating. \n",
      "2. Is it all right if the contractor alters the indemnification language? \n",
      "This is not advised. Indemnification language is carefully worded to afford your Entity as much protection as legally possible, and usually the exact language has been tested in court. Altering the language could weaken your Entity's protection and should only be undertaken on advice of your legal counsel. \n",
      "3. Can we require an A.M. Best rating for a company that is \"admitted\" in California, or is this against the law? \n",
      "Yes; unless the company is providing a surety bond. State law requires owners to accept surety bonds from any surety company, in an effort to improve small firm contractors' chances in successfully bidding a job. If it is a federally approved surety company, you are obligated to accept the surety company. This can be reviewed on the web at: \n",

      "https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/ \n",
      "Remember, just because an insurance company is \"admitted\" does not ensure that they have the financial strength designation required by your contract. Also, we have removed the requirement for \"admitted\" insurers because SO much insurance is now written by Surplus Lines insurers. We now suggest that insurers be \"authorized\" to write business in the state and rated by A. M. Best. These companies can offer advanced forms that can be tailored to specific needs. However, carefully verify that they do not take away needed standard coverages! \n",
      "4. Why should we ask for property insurance on tenants' improvements and betterments, instead of just adding them to our property insurance policy? \n",
      "Unless the lease specifically states that your Entity gains ownership of these improvements as soon as they are installed, your Entity has no insurable interest in them; and, therefore, you usually cannot insure them under your policy. We recommend that you require tenants to insure their TIB's and personal property. If your entity does have an insurable interest, you may want to add the TIB's to your entity's property insurance. \n",

We have worked very hard to recommend insurance requirement specifications that not only protect the Entity but are also realistic and available in the marketplace for the Contractor. \n",
      "6. Does the \"edition date\" on the suggested ISO endorsements matter? \n",
      "Yes; there have been significant reductions in the coverage afforded to additional insureds by \"updated\" versions of these endorsements. A further discussion regarding these changes is contained in the section of this manual describing these endorsements. \n",
      "Document indexed successfully with ID: JzvGnpABZY-SBRPUADIZ\n",
      "7. If the agent or broker changes the word \"endeavor\" to \"will provide\" in the notification of cancellation section of the certificate of insurance, or says we don't need an endorsement because of language on the certificate, are we okay? \n",
      "No; Certificates of insurance DO NOT alter the insurance coverage, and any changes that are necessary need to be endorsed onto the policy with a copy of the endorsement provided to your Entity. Agents and brokers will sometimes try to convince you that endorsements are unnecessary when the certificate has its standard wording changed; if so, you need to point out the boxes across the top of the certificate, one which states that it confers no rights on the holder and DOES NOT amend or alter the insurance and the other that endorsements are needed for additional insured status and may be needed for waiver of subrogation. \n",
      "To ensure that the burden is on the insurance company to notify you of a change in status of coverage, you must receive an endorsement to this effect. Some carriers will provide such an endorsement, especially for larger projects, but most do not. Being named as an \"additional insured\" does NOT obligate the insurer to inform you of any status change in the policy since most policies require only the First Named Insured be notified. \n",
      "Document indexed successfully with ID: KDvGnpABZY-SBRPUATLx\n",
      "Prior editions of this manual have suggested requiring notice of cancellation or coverage changes with 30 days' notice by USPS registered mail with a return receipt. This approach does not seem feasible in the current environment of electronic communications and express mail services. Moreover, some insurers refuse to take on this obligation and, in some states, the cancellation requirements are stronger. \n",
      "Many risk managers are now requiring that the contractor take on this responsibility. While this may be allowing the \"fox to guard the henhouse\", mid-term cancellations and reductions of coverage are SO rare as to make the value of this term less important. If a contract involves a risk SO substantial that the risk of cancellation or coverage reduction is heightened, a project specific policy with the Entity as an Additional Insured may be warranted. \n",
      "NOTE: The latest edition of the standard certificate of insurance form now reads that \"notice of cancellation will be provided in accordance with policy terms and conditions.\" This does not confer special rights on additional insureds and you must ask for an endorsement to the policy if your entity truly desires advance notice of cancellation. \n",

      "8. Can lower limits be permitted when we are dealing with small contractors or artisans, and we are only using them for small jobs?\n",
      "Yes; there are some very small vendors or artisans that may provide a service to your Entity and the cost of obtaining standard limits may not be possible. You should always evaluate the</list>:\n",
      "potential of loss, potential benefit to the organization for the service provided and finally, the vendor's financial capacity to purchase coverage at reasonable rates. The dollar amount of an agreement should never be the sole determining factor on the insurance, however. Even in a small-dollar contract, determine if it involves any exposures that could result in significant loss such as kids, large crowds, high voltage, water, heights, ladders, scaffolding, pyrotechnics, flammable products, alcohol, etc. Please see Appendix A \"Risk Assessment\" for criteria. \n",

      "9. The contractor's agent says that we cannot get the endorsements as required by the Insurance Requirements in Contracts specifications; what can we do?\n",
      "In many instances, the agent or broker has not approached the insurance company with your request - the agent or broker is merely trying to discourage you from asking SO that it will not have to bother. We recommend contacting the broker or agent directly. By informing the agent or broker of the needs and requirements of your Entity, he or she will typically provide you with the necessary endorsements required by your Entity. If this tactic does not work, please call an insurance advisor for confirmation of the unavailability of endorsements from the contractor's company.\n",
      "Document indexed successfully with ID: KzvGnpABZY-SBRPUBzKe\n",
      "9. The contractor's agent says that we cannot get the endorsements as required by the Insurance Requirements in Contracts specifications; what can we do?\n",
      "Note that some states, California among them, now require prior approval of all insurance policy and endorsement forms by the Department of Insurance for \"admitted\" carriers. Therefore, use of custom endorsements may not be practical. However, many construction projects now use non-admitted carriers that are A. M. Best rated and on the LASLI surplus line list. In 2011, the List of Eligible Surplus Line Insurers, (\"LESLI\"), was replaced by the List of Approved Surplus Line Insurers, (\"LASLI\"). The LASLI is a voluntary list of non-admitted insurers that the California Department of Insurance (\"CDI\") has approved for use by surplus line brokers. Often these are part of large insurance groups with the group rating, backing, and resources of the larger, often admitted, insurance group and this allows for customized endorsements. In these situations, we recommend that the Entity work with its insurance advisor and the contractor to determine what forms are available to obtain the desired coverage.\n",
      "10. Do we need an additional insured endorsement on an automobile liability policy?\n",
      "Document indexed successfully with ID: LDvGnpABZY-SBRPUCDLA\n",
      "9. The contractor's agent says that we cannot get the endorsements as required by the Insurance Requirements in Contracts specifications; what can we do?\n",
      "An additional insured endorsement is usually not required on most business auto policies because the standard ISO forms include coverage for \"Anyone liable for the conduct of an insured\". Be careful with non-ISO policies since many, but not all, may contain this provision. It may be wise to require the additional insured coverage by using contract requirement language for the auto policy such as \"the policy shall contain, or be endorsed to contain, Additional Insured coverage for the Entity.\" Also, there are times when general and auto liability coverage are issued on a package policy and the additional insured endorsement can apply to all coverages.\n",
      "Document indexed successfully with ID: LTvGnpABZY-SBRPUCjKX\n",
      "11. How do we determine the proper limits of liability for any given job?\n",
      "Ask yourself how much damage the contractor could cause if it completely mismanaged its work causing bodily injury and property damage to others. Include in your estimate, lost time, wages, extra expense incurred for repairing or replacing the work, and any future impacts. If this amount is more than the suggested amounts shown in the specifications in this manual, use the greater amount.</list>\n",
      "Keep in mind that the $1 million per occurrence/$2 million annual aggregate limits of the CGL were implemented in 1986. If simple cost of living adjustments are applied, that $1 million rises to over $4 million in present value of today's dollars. And some research has shown that tort costs have increased an average of 8.7% annually since 1951 which would take that 1986 $1 million dollars to over $9 million in present value. A settlement including 24-hour care for just one severely injured claimant can reach over $10 million in present value alone.\n",

      "11. How do we determine the proper limits of liability for any given job?\n",
      "The editors have increased the standard requested limits of General Liability to $5 million for contracts with construction risks and to $2 million for other contracts. The Risk Manager will need to evaluate whether contracts require the suggested limits or a different amount. A major capital outlay project may require even higher limits. And some smaller contracts such as facilities use agreements may not merit $2 million, and a lesser amount may suffice. We have not increased the amount of auto liability limits because the business auto policy does not have an annual aggregate which means that the Entity need not be concerned about depletion of limits by other additional insureds, however, a catastrophic loss may prove $1 million of limits inadequate. A contract involving charter transportation could very well merit a $5 million limit or higher. Also, see the answer to question #8 above.\n",

      "12. Can we accept an insurer with less than an A.M. Best Rating A: VII or Standard & Poor's BBB?\n",
      "Yes; but keep in mind that the rating gives your Entity some confidence in that insurer's ability to cover all of its claim liabilities, including your potential claim. By accepting lower A.M. Best or Standard & Poor's ratings, you are exposing your Entity to the possibility that the insurer will be unable to pay any claim you or a third party may present. As an aside, major insurance brokers and agents also insist on placing clients in companies with high A.M. Best and Standard & Poor's ratings, as a way of protecting themselves against potential E&O claims from their clients.\n",
      "Document indexed successfully with ID: MDvGnpABZY-SBRPUGzIG\n",
      "13. How do we discover what the rating of an insurer is?\n",
      "A.M. Best ratings can be accessed over the internet for no cost at www.ambest.com. Go to the \"Member Center\" of the website to register for access to the ratings.\n",
      "You also can go to the Standard & Poor's website to obtain the rating of a specific insurance company. You must register for access, although this is free of charge. Go to www.standardandpoors.com and look for a \"Find a Rating\" link in the margin or header.\n",
      "Document indexed successfully with ID: MTvGnpABZY-SBRPUHDL2\n",
      "14. What do the A.M. Best or Standard & Poor's Ratings mean?\n",
      "See Chapter Two for a discussion of this question. Simply, the Standard & Poor's or A.M. Best ratings give your Entity a sense of the financial strength of the insurance company that is insuring the contractor.\n",
      "Document indexed successfully with ID: MjvGnpABZY-SBRPUHjLi\n",
      "15. Does a contractor need professional liability coverage?\n",
      "A contractor needs professional liability coverage if expected under contract to provide \"professional\" services. The simplest way to decide is to determine whether the nature of the services provided entail \"brain work\" or \"physical work\". If it is only physical work, then a liability policy, general and/or automobile will most likely cover all your exposures to loss.\n",
      "However, if the work or a portion of the work is expected to involve the use of professional knowledge, professional liability insurance is required.\n",
      "As an example, if a contractor is merely following blueprints in constructing a building, it would involve only physical work and a general liability policy will suffice. However, if the contractor is a \"design-build\" firm, or decides that it knows of a better way to construct part of the building, and it alters the blueprints accordingly, then it has crossed the line over into providing \"professional\" service and would then need professional liability coverage to cover a subsequent loss.\n",
      "Document indexed successfully with ID: MzvGnpABZY-SBRPUIDLR\n",
      "16. How long of a period of time do we require the claims-made professional liability insurance to be carried after completion of the project?\n",
      "A \"claims-made\" coverage will only respond to a claim that is presented while the policy is in force or during an extended reporting provision. Therefore, it is imperative that your Entity be protected as long as possible after the completion of the project, SO that any claims caused by faulty design or other professional services (see Question 15) will be covered by the responsible party. Keep in mind your regular general liability policy will not cover professional liability losses, and therefore your contractor may be bare in the event of a claim arising out of professional services rendered on the project. Normally, professional liability policies can be purchased with a three year \"tail\" (reporting period), which will allow claims to be presented up to three years after the professional liability policy expires. If you can get a longer tail in your contract, do SO.\n",
      "Document indexed successfully with ID: NDvGnpABZY-SBRPUIjLo\n",
      "17. Does a contractor need proof of automobile liability when hired to work on the premises?\n",
      "Yes; for the simple reason that the contractor has to use some means of transportation to reach your premises, and to transport tools, supplies, and materials. If the contractor is determined to be engaged in business on your Entity's behalf when it is involved in an automobile accident, then your Entity may be held liable. Further, since owners of vehicles are required to carry insurance anyway, this requirement carries little burden to the contractor.\n",
      "Document indexed successfully with ID: NTvGnpABZY-SBRPUJTIU\n",
      "18. Should we ask to be named as an additional insured on the contractor's professional liability policy?\n",
      "No; the contractor's professional liability insurer will not comply with such a request. The reason is that the insurer does not want to pick up your Entity's professional liability hazards, which it would do if you were an additional insured. Professional liability policies are specifically underwritten based on the professional history of the contractor. A contractor's insurer is not interested in underwriting your Entity's professional risk, and therefore will not add your Entity as an additional insured on the contractor's policy.\n",

      "19. What can be done if we don't have the proof of insurance when it is time to start the work?\n",
      "There is very little that can be done at this point in the process, which is why we strongly recommend that the indemnity and insurance specifications be sent out with the pre-bid package. There are no good choices when this situation occurs; either you must delay the work while you wait for the proof, or you must take some risk until the proof is received, and hope that the contractor's insurance meets your specifications.\n",

      "20. Why can't we accept a certificate of insurance as proof of the Entity being named as an additional insured?\n",
      "Across the top of the current ACORD Certificate of Insurance are the following words:\n",
      "IMPORTANT: If the certificate holder is an ADDITIONAL INSURED, the policy(ies) must be endorsed. If SUBROGATION IS WAIVED, subject to the terms and conditions of the policy, certain policies may require an endorsement. A statement on this certificate does not confer rights to the certificate holder in lieu of such endorsement(s).\n",
      "If any agent or broker tries to convince you that the certificate truly does confer rights or coverages, and that you therefore do not need the endorsements you are requesting (and some will) you can direct their attention to this statement.\n",

      "21. Why do we need an indemnity clause in our contract when we are added as an additional insured on the liability policy?\n",
      "Insurance is only one way that the contractor can financially guarantee its liabilities. If you have an indemnity provision in your contract with the contractor, that contractor is obligated to indemnify your Entity whether or not its insurance covers the loss. This puts the burden on the contractor rather than your Entity to make certain that its coverage is sufficient and current. Therefore, make sure your indemnity language is strong, and that if the contractor does not carry sufficient or correct insurance to cover their obligations to your Entity, it does have the assets to indemnify those uninsured or underinsured exposures.\n",
      "Document indexed successfully with ID: OTvGnpABZY-SBRPULTIH\n",
      "21. Why do we need an indemnity clause in our contract when we are added as an additional insured on the liability policy?\n",
      "In fact, the written indemnity clause in the contract is the real trigger for coverage as your contract, under normal circumstances, is an \"Insured Contract\" as defined under the Commercial General Liability policy (CGL). The CGL confers automatic coverage for \"Insured Contracts,\" (unless endorsements provide otherwise) but the Entity must have a written contract containing indemnity language in your favor prior to the loss in order to trigger coverage. As a result, the indemnity clause is crucial to trigger coverage and may even cover items not covered by the Additional Insured Endorsement.\n",
      "Document indexed successfully with ID: OjvGnpABZY-SBRPULjL0\n",
      "22. Should we ask for a waiver of subrogation from the contractor and/or insurer?\n",
      "YES, always include in your contract terms; if your Entity does not do so, the contractor's insurance company can look for reimbursement of any claim payments they have made when they believe your Entity's negligence contributed to the loss. \"Subrogation\" is the transfer to the insurance company of the contractor's right to collect for damages from another party, in this case, your Entity. If the contractor waives rights of subrogation in the contract their insurers have no rights to pursue your Entity for reimbursement, regardless of whether or not an endorsement is issued, because the insurer's rights are no greater than their insured's.\n",
      "Some insurers require their insureds to report and pay for waivers of subrogation, and all policies prohibit waivers of subrogation after a loss has occurred. However, any recourse the insurer may have is with their insured and will not create subrogation rights versus your Entity.\n",

      "22. Should we ask for a waiver of subrogation from the contractor and/or insurer?\n",
      "In addition, if your Entity is named as an \"additional insured\" on the contractor's liability policy, current case law holds that it is against public policy to allow an insurer to subrogate against its own insured, even an \"additional insured.\":\n",
      "Editor's note: the phrase \"waiver of subrogation\" is no longer used in the ISO Commercial General Liability form; rather the phrase \"Transfer of Rights of Recovery against Others to Us\" is now used. While the editors normally favor using the current industry language rather than historical legal terms, in this case we believe \"waiver of subrogation\" remains the best way to communicate to contractors and the legal community the intent of the agreement. \n",
      "Document indexed successfully with ID: PDvGnpABZY-SBRPUMTLZ\n",
      "23. If a hold harmless agreement does not absolve us of liability, why do we need to include it?\n",
      "While a hold harmless agreement does not relieve you of legal liability for your Entity's sole negligence, it should obligate the contractor and his insurer to pay for legal defense and damages due to your Entity's vicarious liability arising from the contractor's activities.\n",
      "Each word in the phrase \"hold harmless, defend and indemnify\" conveys a different duty to be performed by the indemnitor. Even if the indemnity agreement is not fully enforced, or the indemnified party has separate negligence not included in the indemnity, the written agreement to indemnify is essential to triggering contractual liability coverage under the \"insured contract\" definition in the ISO CGL policy of your contractor. Without any agreement to indemnify your Entity is bare as respects the contractor's insurance.\n",

      "24. Should we require bonds in contracts that are not construction related?\n",
      "Yes; there are a number of situations when your Entity may want to require bonds. You may want to consider bonds when dealing with certain types of vendors, including those providing personalized products such as customized information systems, equipment, or other specific services for your Entity. Although bonds may not be required on all vendor agreements, it is important to understand how they may save your Entity in the event that the vendor fails to deliver or lacks the funding to finish its project.\n",

      "25. Should we require that contractors provide proof of terrorism coverage in their insurance programs?\n",
      "Maybe; the Federal Government has mandated that all insurers offer coverage for \"terrorist acts\" for an additional premium. Though this coverage is currently available, many insureds are declining it due to the additional cost. It is unclear to what extent a contractor could be responsible for any act of terrorism that occurs while performing tasks for your Entity. You may consider the coverage on construction projects which may be impacted as a result of a terrorist attack. As with any exposure, you must identify the potential for risk. If the project is politically sensitive or considered highly visible, the inclusion of terrorism coverage may be necessary.\n",

      "26. What do I do if my contractor states that they are self-insured for liability, auto, and workers' compensation, and they cannot provide a certificate of insurance?\n",
      "In the State of California, organizations that are self-insured for workers' compensation must have a Certificate of Consent to Self-Insure issued by the State of California Department of Industrial Relations. They must also have authorization from the State to self-insure their auto exposure, but this is not the case for general liability.

      "Yes; many contractors are either sole proprietors or partnerships.

      "28. Should I require wet signatures on endorsements to policies? \n",
      "It depends. If an endorsement is issued and delivered as a part of the policy, it does not need a signature as the complete policy was signed off by an authorized representative when it was issued. Usually there is a schedule of endorsements attached to the signed Declarations page and if your endorsement is listed on that schedule then it was a part of the policy at issuance and does not need a signature. Mid-term endorsements should be signed to confirm that an authorized representative has agreed to the policy change. A copy of the updated Policy Declarations and Endorsements page can be your best tool to verify the added endorsement. Keep in mind that all of this effort is intended to raise your confidence that the insurer has agreed to provide the required coverage, rather than an unauthorized intermediary. Indeed, you could next require that the signatory prove that he or she is authorized - which you might do if the signatory is a retail broker or agent, rather than a company underwriter or delegated managing general underwriter. At some point, it is reasonable to assume that the people who are issuing documents to you have the authority to do SO. \n",

      "Let's face it, dealing with indemnity and insurance requirements can be tedious. No one likes to haggle about the terms of a contract or worry about whether a contractor has provided the correct insurance. Requesting, obtaining, and verifying insurance for contracted goods and services takes time, can be aggravating, and most often doesn't seem to make any difference, since most contracts are completed without incident. However, when an incident occurs, all of those efforts become worth it. Public entities and businesses have saved millions of dollars by successfully tendering claims or suits arising from contracted goods or services, from the largest public works projects to the smallest service contracts.\n",
      "The reasons for including a strong indemnification clause in your contracts and requiring insurance coverage include:\n",
      "Your entity can be held liable for damages caused by your contractors \n",

      "3. Select the Appropriate Insurance Specifications \n",
      "4. Verify Insurance Coverage \n",
      "5. Report Claims Promptly\n",
      "In the practice of good risk management, your Entity should attempt to transfer the risk of accidental loss accruing through its contractual relationships. Usually, your Entity will require the other party to a contract (contractor) to assume your Entity's liability arising out of the contractor's negligent delivery of products, services, or activities. This transfer generally is appropriate, as the contractor is most often the party in the best position to control loss.\n",
      "Document indexed successfully with ID: TDvGnpABZY-SBRPUTzIJ\n",
      "SUMMARY\n",
      "This intended transfer of risk is achieved by requiring suppliers, contractors, tenants, and users of public facilities (i.e. the other party to most Entity contracts) to hold your entity harmless in an indemnification agreement arising from their products, activities, or use of your facilities. The best way to assure that the transfer actually takes place (i.e. that a loss will be paid by someone other than your Entity) is to require a strong indemnity agreement and insurance appropriate in the contract for goods or services. In addition to protecting the contractor, the insurance should also protect the Entity, its officers, officials, employees, and volunteers.\n",
      "This section is intended to give users a brief overview of the contractual risk transfer process and a set of insurance specifications that will apply to most situations.

Some contracted services do carry more risks; even the smallest job has the potential for catastrophe. For this section, we are assuming the typical kinds of risks for most contracted services, such as professional services, maintenance agreements, and other contracted work performed for your entity, with the exception of construction contracts. Please see Chapter 3 for more details regarding construction projects and Chapter 4 for a discussion of other special types of situations.\n",

      "Your contracts should contain a Hold Harmless (Indemnity) agreement that includes an obligation to defend your entity (including employees, officials, agents, etc.) and is meant to be interpreted as broadly as possible in your favor. Hold Harmless agreements are language that shifts responsibility for loss or damage arising from the activities of a contract from one party (your entity) to the other (the contractor). Your contractor acts as your representative while performing services for you, provided they are within the scope of your agreement. Any damages caused in such performance on your behalf can be collected against you. \"Hold Harmless\" language allows you to tender the claim of the damaged third party to the contractor for defense and indemnity by the contractor or their insurer.\n",

      "A Hold Harmless is the Contractor's promise to pay for claims caused, in whole or in part, from its activities. Requiring insurance helps to ensure the contractor will have the money to deliver on that promise. Therefore, it's important to require insurance of the proper type and in sufficient amounts to protect your entity.\n",
      "It's also important to inform contractors of the insurance requirements early in the contract or bid process. This accomplishes two goals. First, it eliminates any questions that the bidder may have about the nature of the required insurance. Second, the bidder has the opportunity to forward the forms to its insurer or agent for approval before the bid is submitted, thus eliminating delay or the submission of unacceptable insurance documents after the contract or bid is awarded.\n",

Some policies may automatically name your entity as an additional insured if required in a written contract, or they may issue a \"blanket\" endorsement to that effect.

Best, particularly if your contractor is covered by a captive, Self-Insured Group (SIG), risk pool, or other \"alternative\" risk transfer mechanism. In such cases, you will need to research the company by referring to the Internet or requesting documentation from the agent. Also, enlist the advice of your insurance broker or risk management consultant. We are no longer suggesting that coverage must be written with \"admitted\" markets. In recent years an increasing percentage of coverage has moved to surplus lines markets that are \"licensed\" to conduct business, but not \"admitted.\" These non- admitted markets may offer customized forms and better coverage and better pricing than admitted markets. But, a non-admitted market may not be supported by a state's insolvency fund. As a result, you may consider asking for a higher financial size rating as an indication of a non-admitted insurer's financial capacity. In the manual we now use the term \"authorized\" insurers to include both admitted and non-admitted surplus lines insurers.

      "Insurance requirements in a contract ensure that the organization you are contracting with will have adequate assets available in the event of a loss arising out of the work performed for your Entity. The use of insurance is not the only means of guaranteeing that an organization will have adequate resources. Some very large organizations may choose to self-insure their liabilities. In that event, you may need to examine the organization's financial statements or receive a letter of credit from a banking institution to guarantee the adequacy of assets.

      "Be as Specific as Possible in Describing Types of Insurance Required\n",
      "Avoid using phrases which do not have a specific meaning. For example, the term \"public liability\" does not have a definite meaning in common usage or in the insurance industry. If you use an ambiguous term, your Entity may intend that a relatively broad coverage be purchased, yet a limited coverage form would still comply with the written requirement. This ambiguity is reduced by stating the titles or exact types of coverage forms to be maintained. The insurance specifications provided in this manual refer to specific Insurance Services Office (ISO) coverage forms wherever possible. While overwhelmingly industry standard, not all insurers use ISO forms, but they should have similar forms or policy language they can provide. Avoid the use of language such as \"or its equivalent\" since this is ambiguous and use the phrase \"with coverage at least as broad as\" the ISO forms. However, use of non-standard ISO language is a reason to review the forms and endorsements carefully, including a review of the policy language if in doubt.\n",

      "Be as Specific as Possible in Describing Types of Insurance Required\n",
      "In particular, your Entity should require that liability insurance be written on an \"occurrence basis\". \"Claims-made\" coverage should be accepted only as an exception after verifying that occurrence- based coverage is not available. Professional liability insurance is usually available only on a claims-made basis and will be discussed later in this chapter.\n",

      "The manual no longer discusses disclosure of deductibles because it is the responsibility of the insurer, not the additional insured or loss payee, to recover deductibles from the insured. If the other party maintains self-insured retentions (SIRs), your Entity must seek reimbursement directly from the other party in accordance with the indemnity or hold-harmless clause of the contract. If the other party is financially unable to reimburse your Entity, or if the indemnification clause in the contract is set aside by a court, your Entity would bear the amount of the SIR or perhaps be left with no coverage at all from the contractor's policy if the SIR was not paid. As of this writing, at least one court has held that an additional insured to a policy has no right to satisfy the SIR if the first named insured is unable to do so, based on policy language that unambiguously allowed only the named insured to satisfy the SIR. This situation can also occur when the subcontractor is not named in a suit and therefore is not required to respond and spend money that would count toward the SIR. In such cases, your entity may have to file a cross-complaint to force the subcontractor to respond and satisfy the SIR.\n",

You can include language that allows your Entity to\n",
      "withhold payment up to the amount of the SIR and act as the contractor's agent in satisfying the policy SIR.\n",
      "Also, some policies with SIRs do not require the insurer to provide legal defense. In such cases, your Entity might have to pay its own defense or seek reimbursement from the contractor. Moreover, a recent decision in California held the insurer did not have to pay claims where a bankrupt insured was not able to personally satisfy the SIR. Therefore, you should require disclosure and approval of SIRs and discuss them with your risk management advisor as necessary. Include language in your Contract requiring that the policy language shall provide, or be endorsed to provide, that the SIR may be satisfied by either the named insured or Entity.\n",

      "How to Evaluate a SIR\n",
      "As described in Chapter 1, a Self-Insured Retention (SIR) is different than a deductible. Under a policy with a deductible, the insurer adjusts (and controls) the claim and is reimbursed by the insured for the amount of the deductible. Under a policy with an SIR (SIR Policy), the insured controls the claim through the SIR, such as selection of counsel and right to settle. Unlike a policy with a deductible, under an SIR Policy, the insurer has no duty to defend or pay damages until the SIR has been paid. There has been litigation involving a bankrupt insured where the court found that the additional insured had no right to pay the deductible and trigger the coverage above the SIR. As a result, it is necessary to pay special attention when an SIR Policy is providing required liability coverage.\n",

      "How to Evaluate a SIR\n",
      "It is not necessarily appropriate to simply disallow a vendor/contractor to utilize an SIR Policy. Keep in mind that nearly all large public entities and pooling organizations utilize SIRs for the same reason your contractors may use them - they want to control their claims and avoid the frictional costs of trading dollars with their insurers/re-insurers. There are numerous organizations with well-funded and well-managed self-insurance programs.

      "Funding of SIR - A well-funded self-insurance program should be able to demonstrate funding of the SIR at a reasonable level. For a smaller SIR, it may not be necessary to ask for a copy of a recent actuarial study (and they may not have one, say for a $100,000.00 SIR). For a larger SIR, you should obtain more information, and at least a certification by\n",

      "Excess/Reinsurer Review - The number of insurers offering SIR Policies is relatively small. SIR Policies are considered \"specialty\" contracts and are carefully underwritten by \"specialty\" underwriters. As a result, you would normally expect to see an SIR policy issued by a larger \"A\" rated carrier - a minimum of size X in our opinion for the lead (first excess layer) underwriter.\n",

Examples of such claims include design errors of architects or engineers and malpractice of doctors or lawyers. An expert in the subject field is almost always necessary to establish the duty of care and render an opinion on whether or not it was met when attempting to prove a claim for damages.\n",
      "Claims arising from professional services performed for your Entity will name the consultant, your Entity and any other connected party as defendants. Even though the consultant may be the party\n",

      "Professional Liability Insurance\n",
      "Professional liability insurance provides protection against covered claims for damages by reason of any act, error or omission committed or alleged to have been committed by the insured. It is also referred to as \"Errors and Omissions\" or \"E&O\" insurance. Coverage provided by professional liability insurance policies differs from coverage provided by general liability insurance. General liability policies exclude professional liability exposures such as design errors. General liability policies are also limited to claims for bodily injury, property damage, advertising injury, and personal injury. Professional liability policies cover a broader range of financial and economic loss from an error or omission even if no bodily injury or property damage happened. This type of coverage is for consultants, attorneys, architects, engineers, and others who give advice, specifications, plans, or other professional services. Exhibit 2 (at the end of this chapter) provides a sample set of specifications for consultant insurance requirements. Limits required by these sample specifications are $2,000,000. On large projects, or those with significant potential for loss such as bridges or dams, higher limits are appropriate.\n",

      "Professional Liability Insurance\n",
      "You must also exercise judgment on the subject of minimum acceptable insurer requirements. For some professions, limited insurance markets exist for professional liability coverage. There may be no insurers meeting your Entity's standard insurer requirements that are willing to write the particular kind of coverage required. In such cases, you must sometimes be willing to relax standard insurer rating requirements. When doing so, you should attempt to evaluate the financial condition of the consultant and its insurer, determine how long the consultant has been in business, how long it has maintained insurance coverage, and how long its insurer has been writing the kind of professional liability in question. For assistance in evaluating professional liability insurers, contact your risk management advisor.\n",

      "Additional Insured Status\n",
      "Because of the highly personal nature of professional liability insurance (the insurer covers the professional's competence); insurers generally will not add additional insureds to the policy unless\n",

      "Claims-Made Coverage\n",
      "Most professional liability coverage is written on a \"claims-made\" basis, rather than the \"occurrence\" or \"accident\" coverage for general and auto liability. This means the policy in force on the date a claim is made against the consultant is the policy that responds to the loss, not the policy in force on the date damages occur. For architects and engineers especially, the date of a claim may be many years after the design and construction of a structure and months after any defects caused damage. For this reason, this manual recommends requesting continuation of professional liability coverage for at least three to five years after completion of the subject of the design work. For large projects you may want to require an even longer time period and/or require a policy with a built in \"tail\" for reporting claims in the future.\n",
      "Document indexed successfully with ID: qDvGnpABZY-SBRPU_DJK\n",
      "Claims-Made Coverage\n",
      "Because professional liability insurance is almost always written on a claims-made basis, Entities that hire architects or engineers should have concern about coverage for latent defects or design errors that may result in future claims after the current coverage has expired. One solution to this problem is to require the design professional to agree to maintain coverage for a specified period after the project has been completed (extended reporting period, or tail, coverage). However, this requirement may be very difficult to enforce. If the project is large enough, the architect's or engineer's insurer may provide a policy specific to the project or \"project policy\" in the name of the Entity, with a built-in tail. The policy may cover all design professionals on a project. This arrangement affords greater protection for the Entity's interests but will require an additional premium for the separate policy. Therefore, this is only cost effective on large projects (generally when architects and engineering fees exceed $1 million).\n",

      "The \"trigger\" of coverage differs for Claims-Made policies rather than the more typical Occurrence policy. The trigger of coverage for an occurrence policy is the date of the loss, regardless of when the claim is made. And as many public entities have seen, claims for certain long-tail exposures can be reported many years after the initial incident that caused the loss.\n",
      "For Claims-Made policies the trigger of coverage is the date the claim is made against the insured. The loss also must have occurred after any applicable Retroactive Date and reported to the insurer within the policy period or any applicable extended reporting period. Typically, the insured has 30-60 days after policy expiration to report the claim, and extended reporting periods of a year are more are generally offered for an additional premium.\n",

In some cases, the consulting firm will not own automobiles and therefore may not purchase full automobile liability coverage. Regardless of whether or not a firm owns any autos of their own, they should carry coverage for their non-owned and hired automobile exposure. Non-owned and hired automobile liability insurance covers vehicles owned by consultants' employees and protects your entity from claims arising out of the use of personal or rented vehicles used in the course of business. To verify coverage, request a certificate of insurance listing the carrier, coverage terms and covered auto symbols - hired is symbol 8 and non-owned is symbol 9.

Many persons in that position will purchase Short and/or Long-Term Disability to cover their own exposure. States may have requirements to provide Workers' Compensation for certain types of activities or occupations that otherwise would be exempt and may require filing a declaration that the person qualifies for the exemption that can be requested to satisfy your insurance requirements. Regardless, you should request written confirmation from the other party before agreeing to waive this important coverage. The confirmation should include an agreement to obtain Workers' Compensation and notify you if any employee is hired, to verify proof of coverage for any subcontractors, and to hold harmless and defend you in case of claims arising from failure to provide benefits.\n",

The Internal Revenue Service may ultimately make a determination whether or not a consultant should be considered an employee. You can review its criteria on its website at http://www.irs.gov. The key factor is the amount of control you exercise over the work, especially whether you have the right to control only the result of the work, not the means and methods. However, there are other factors and other types of benefits to be considered. Your agency should carefully review all consultant agreements to avoid a ruling that you are responsible for benefits, payroll taxes, social security, pension, and Medicare payments as a result of the consultant's function.\n",

      "Indemnity Limitations\n",
      "Special care is needed in drafting indemnification requirements for contracts with consultants. Appendix C explains special restrictions on indemnity agreements with design professionals. In addition, most professional liability insurers exclude liability assumed under contract by their insureds. However, most general liability policies in use today provide an exception to the contract exclusion to provide coverage for bodily injury and property damage liability assumed under an \"insured contract\". Therefore, the indemnity agreement should be carefully worded SO that the consultant agrees to defend and indemnify your Entity for bodily injury or property damage arising out of the consultant's negligent acts or omissions in performance of the work. This assumption of liability is insurable under general liability policies.\n",
      "Professional liability policies generally do not contain an \"insured contract\" exception in their contract exclusions. The exclusion applies unless the liability arises from an error, omission, or negligent act of the insured and would have attached in the absence of such agreement. While the insurer will protect the consultant, it may not honor certain provisions of the hold harmless, such as a duty to defend or pay costs as incurred. For this reason, many consultants attempt to negotiate away such provisions.\n",

      "In such cases, you may have to rely on the consultant's or another contractor's general liability coverage for defense and ongoing reimbursement of costs, and you may have to file a cross- complaint to assure that the consultant and insurer pay for their share of any loss.\n",
      "Note, however, that your Entity would seldom be liable for any share of a true E&O loss, as the concept of professional liability applies to a practitioner of that profession. The most common ways your Entity could be directly liable for a professional error include negligently choosing the consultant or negligently approving a design or work product. On any large construction loss there will be allegations of professional negligence as well as construction defects attributed to the contractor or various subcontractors, SO the goal is to make sure the consultant or insurer pays for its share of the damage.\n",

If the contractor's insurance does not cover all of their indemnity exposures under the contract, it is its responsibility to obtain the necessary coverages to satisfy its agreement with your Entity.\n",
      "Always remember that insurance is only one way that the contractor can indemnify your Entity. There should always be a section in the contract that states that the lack of insurance does not negate the contractor's obligations under the contract. We recommend that the manual user consult with their Entity's attorney for specific language for this section's wording. Make sure your indemnity language is strong, and if the contractor does not carry sufficient or correct insurance to cover its obligations to your Entity, make certain it has assets to indemnify those uninsured or underinsured areas.\n",

The potential for loss in construction related events can be devastating. The size and nature of most construction agreements give you a significant advantage in the negotiation process for requiring insurance. You need to carefully examine all of the exposures to risk in the construction agreement and then must require specific insurance for each exposure.\n",

Discussion on the specifics of the project should occur early on in the design process. This will better position your Entity to develop your insurance requirements and provide the bidding contractors with all of the requirements before the bids are submitted. It should be made clear during the pre-bid meetings that your Entity has exact insurance requirements and contractors should be encouraged to contact their brokers/carriers as they are developing their bids. Your Entity should precisely advise bidding contractors that you will not accept change orders that are based on insurance costs that were not appropriately considered.\n",

      "What is a \"Construction Contract\"?\n",
      "The reader needs to be aware that the term \"construction contract\" has specific meaning as it relates to public entities, and there are a number of requirements and restrictions that relate to risk transfer and management of such contracts. One significant restriction is the extent to which a public entity may be held harmless for damages arising from construction contracts, as more fully explained in Appendix C. For purposes of this section, we refer you to the following California Civil Code section defining these contracts as they relate to the indemnity restrictions:\n",
      "Civil Code $2783: As used in Sections 2782 and 2782.5, \"construction contract\" is defined as any agreement or understanding, written or oral, respecting the construction, surveying, design, specifications, alteration, repair, improvement, maintenance, removal of or demolition of any building, highway, road, parking facility, bridge, railroad, airport, pier or dock, excavation or other structure, development or other improvement to real or personal property, or an agreement to perform any portion thereof or any act collateral thereto, or to perform any service reasonably related thereto, including, but not limited to, the erection of all structures or\n",

      "A discussion of various State Public Contract Codes is beyond the scope of this manual. However, the editors want to make the reader aware of certain common provisions, such as bonding requirements and written acknowledgement by the contractor of the requirement to provide workers' compensation or approved self-insurance, that impact the insurance requirements for construction projects. The reader who is regularly involved in managing the risks and/or insurance requirements for construction contracts should be familiar with their Code's terms and conditions related to their type of entity and their typical public contracts. The IRIC manual editors recommend that capital project agreements include specific language direction that any claims or change orders under the agreement shall be presented in writing, subject to a mediation process that includes requirements to \"meet and confer\" as well as mediation.\n",

      "Surety Bonds\n",
      "\"Surety\" is a three-party contract wherein a person or entity agrees to be responsible for the contractual obligations of another should those obligations not be met.\n",
      "A surety bond is a contractual agreement under which the surety company guarantees the performance of certain obligations of the principal (contractor) for the benefit of another (entity). In public works contracts, for example, the surety company guarantees the completion of the construction project by the contractor for the benefit of the public entity.\n",
      "The surety company stands behind the bonded contractor and guarantees the completion of the bonded work. In this way, the surety bond is a risk transfer technique similar to but different than insurance. A bond differs from insurance in two fundamental ways: (1) the number of parties to the contract, and (2) the surety's right of indemnity from the contractor, if they fail.\n",
      "Insurance has two parties to the insuring contract: the insurer and the insured (policyholder). A bond, however, has three parties to the surety contract: the bonding company (surety aka\n",
      "obligor), the entity being bonded (principal), and the entity who benefits in the event of a bonded default (obligee).\n",
      "Document indexed successfully with ID: ETvHnpABZY-SBRPUsjM1\n",
      "Surety Bonds\n",
      "A surety company also has the right of indemnity from the principal. If a surety is called upon to make a payment on a bond because the principal failed to meet a bonded obligation to the obligee, the surety may recover the amount of loss from the principal (also referred to as the obligor).\n",
      "Surety bonds are designed to help the obligee ensure that the contractor will complete the job in accordance with the contract. If a bonded contractor defaulted on any obligation of a bonded job, the surety may seek to recover any amounts it paid to the obligee (the Entity) from the principal (the bonded contractor). Thus, the bonded contractor has a punitive incentive through the legal constraints of the bond to complete the work expected by the obligee.\n",
      "Further, surety companies carefully underwrite applicants for bonds by examining the contractor's managerial and financial ability to undertake and complete a job. Thus, the requirement for surety bonds also serves to eliminate truly unqualified contractors from the bid process.\n",
      "Document indexed successfully with ID: EjvHnpABZY-SBRPUtDMS\n",
      "Surety Bonds\n",
      "All public works contracts should include a requirement that the contractor furnish contract bonds, but you may choose to exercise discretion for certain types of jobs that have inconsequential cost or risk of other harm should a contractor fail to complete the work.\n",
      "The surety bonds related to public work contracts include: Bid Bond, Performance Bond and Payment Bonds and Completion Bonds. Collectively, they are referred to as Contract Bonds.\n",

      "Document indexed successfully with ID: FjvHnpABZY-SBRPUuDNq\n",
      "Subdivision or Completion Bond\n",
      "A Subdivision or Completion Bond is a type of performance bond that includes all the improvements to be made in a subdivision. The key difference is that the developer must pay the cost of building the improvements if the contractor fails to complete them, not the public agency. The owner/developer purchases the bond and serves as the principal, rather than the contractor, and is ultimately responsible if the contractor fails to complete the work.\n",
      "The contractor should obtain Performance and Payment Bonds with penalties equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the contract price as determined from the prices in the bid form. The bond amount may be periodically adjusted as necessary to cover and satisfy all payment obligations arising from the contract.\n",
      "The contractor should file the required bond with the public entity prior to or simultaneous with the execution of the contract.\n",
      "Although bonds are most commonly used in construction agreements, there are other specific agreements where performance bonds may be used by your Entity. Purchase agreements for specific items such as software development or other products specifically engineered by the vendor may incorporate language requiring a performance/material bond.\n",

      "Subdivision or Completion Bond\n",
      "Performance and Payments Bonds should be submitted on forms provided by the public entity. The surety should possess a minimum rating from A. M. Best Company of A:VII.

      "Builder's Risk Insurance (Course of Construction)\n",
      "Insurance for property under construction is called \"Builder's Risk\" or \"Course of Construction\" insurance. This protects the interests of both the owner and contractor by covering property under construction as well as equipment and materials to be installed. Pricing takes into account changing values as construction nears completion.\n",
      "Often, the contractor provides builder's risk insurance on construction projects as a part of their construction services. The recommended default position in the insurance specifications require the contractor to provide it to protect both their and your interest in property while in the course of construction. However, many public entities have Builder's Risk coverage as part of their own property policy, and many larger agencies, or those in large programs, may be able to obtain broader or less expensive coverage from their own insurer. For large projects it's worth having a conversation with your broker about this and perhaps having the contractor provide a bid with and without the Builder's Risk cover in order to compare terms and pricing.\n",
      "Items to consider include:\n",
      "Perils \n",
      "Coverage should be written on an \"all risk\" (aka \"Special\" policy form) basis, and the perils of earthquake and flood should be considered for inclusion, but can be problematic due to pricing considerations. In an \"all risk\" form, earthquake and flood are the major exclusions. Earthquake and flood coverage are normally optional based on the needs and location of the project. For example, earthquake and/or flood coverage must be included if a grant funding the project or financing arrangements (i.e., bonds) require it. In California, Public Contract Code §7105 limits the amount of coverage that can be required for an \"Act of God\" defined as earthquake or tsunami, SO this code may need to be considered if earthquake or tsunami coverage is to be required. \n",

Case law holds that structures are defined broader than buildings. Simply put, all buildings are structures, but not all structures are buildings. Thus, any physical damage to a structure that is not defined as a building would not be covered until standard RPL policies. For more complete reference, see Katsoff V. Lucertini, 103 A.2d 812 (CT 1954). Other risks include physical damage to tools, property, equipment, and items lost in transit. \n",
      "Limits \n",
      "The Railroad will determine the limit required; however, low risk jobs' RPL policies commonly require coverage limits of $2 million per occurrence and $2 million aggregate. Low risk jobs do not pose inherent risks nor the potential for interference to railway operations or tracks. High hazard jobs are typically excluded in CGL policies - SO your RPL is designed to fill this void. Despite the fear or apprehension contained within the name, high risk jobs are those pertaining to work along rail corridors or otherwise within 50 feet of railroad property. These jobs typically require limits of $10 million per occurrence and $10 million aggregate.\n",

      "Collectively called \"Cyber Risk\" these exposures are rapidly expanding and changing as we become more reliant upon technology and insurers respond to emerging statutes, regulations and case law. In an era of accelerated mass digitization there is no longer a question of \"will\" my Entity be breached, rather, \"when\" and what can we do now to prepare? In the following section, we will address some of the implications of privacy laws and what your Entity can do to mitigate risk from both a contract and internal policy & procedure perspective.\n",

      "The risks associated with IT products and services is ever-evolving and increasing which means serious attention needs to be paid to the contract wording along with the insurance requirements. The ability to transfer these risks to traditional insurance or look to typical contractual indemnity is severely limited due to the complexity of these risks.\n",
      "Cyber risks and the related management techniques can be broken down into first party risks, related to damages directly to an entity's own systems or data, and third-party risks related to liability to others for breaches of security that may lead to loss of privacy or potential for identity theft for which the Entity may be responsible. There is no approved standard for cyber liability policies and the coverage and terms vary significantly between policies. It's important to review the coverage you have in place closely with your broker and legal counsel to ensure the coverage will respond the way you expect it to.\n",

      "Many vendor's services require access your data, and contracts oftentimes do not clearly define the responsibilities and obligations of the vendor when doing SO. With clearly defined privacy and data security provisions in vendor contracts, your organization can ensure that vendors have a responsibility to protect your data and there is an adequate remedy if they fail to honor that duty. Also, discussing these provisions during contract negotiations may provide valuable insight on the maturity of a vendor's information security posture.\n",

      "To include or not to include Technology Professional Liability (Tech E&O)? Third party vendors, services, consultants, and advisors may perform a wide variety of services for the entity. Organizations that provide technology services or technology products for compensation may have professional liability known as \"Technology (or IT) Professional Liability\". The agency may have vicarious liability for the work performed by the vendor/consultant. In other words, when any technology services or technology products for compensation is provided as a service for the entity by a vendor, the exposure is referred to as \"Technology Professional Liability.\" See following Exhibit 7 for sample contract language relating to Tech E&O. Unfortunately, it is difficult, if not impossible, to apply the same privacy and data security provisions to every contract. It is important for your organization to determine the types of data to be accessed by the vendor, and what they will be doing with it. The answers to those questions will determine what provisions are necessary and how far you can\n",

      "For purposes of drafting hold harmless language and insurance requirements for contracts with third parties who may provide cyber and tech services, including data processing services to your entity, the reader is advised to work closely with his or her legal, technical, and insurance advisors to ensure the broadest possible indemnity, not limited to bodily injury or property damage but should specifically include wording that encompasses cyber-related risks that include theft, loss or misuse of data, release of private information and responsibility for costs, fines and penalties that the entity might incur. Beyond that, questions should be asked about the contractor's data security procedures, including whether or not they have been audited to industry standards regarding their controls over information technology and related processes. In drafting the agreement, it is suggested that the following points be taken into consideration:\n",
      "1. Essential Privacy and Security Terms \n",
      "Every contract with privacy and data security implications should contain certain defined terms. Organizations should push for definitions that align with the business objectives of the contract and encompass all data accessed or processed by the vendor. \n",
      "a. Personal Information - Properly defining this term will ensure the vendor's duties align with the organization's obligation to protect personal information under state, federal and international law. \n",

      "Document indexed successfully with ID: YTvInpABZY-SBRPUOTPl\n",
      "2. Confidentiality\n",
      "Standard contract language is often too narrow or omits provisions of confidentiality for information that is protected under state and federal law, which can result in disputes if it is unclear whether information that has been breached falls under the contract. Specifically, we recommend that you think through the following:\n",
      "i. Make sure that the definition of Confidential Information is broad and applies to the relevant data or intellectual property the vendor collects, stores, or processes on your behalf. If the vendor collects any personal information, protected health information (\"PHI\"), or payment card information (PCI), include these items in the definition of confidential information to ensure confidential treatment of the same. \n",
      "ii. If your organization is providing credentials to the vendor to access your network or systems, make sure that such credentials are deemed confidential information. \n",
      "iii. Require access to confidential information only on a \"need to know\" basis. \n",
      "iv. Require vendor to enter into similar confidentiality agreements with staff, third parties, and subcontractors who may have access to confidential information.\n",

      "3. Data Protection Provisions\n",
      "Clear and specific data protection provisions will allow your organization to limit its exposure due to a vendor's failure to employ standard security practices. The data protection provisions should apply to all vendor personnel, including contractors and subcontractors with access to data. Depending on the relationship, you may want to require that all vendor personnel agree to the data protection provisions in writing.:\n",
      "a. Standard of Care It is important to establish a baseline standard of care for vendors to employ when accessing or processing your organization's information. Minimally, vendors should be expected to use the same degree of care, but no less than a reasonable degree of care, to prevent the unauthorized use, dissemination, or publication of your information as it uses to protects its own, including standard anti- virus/malware deployment. \n",
      "b. Information Security Program - Consider requiring your vendor to have a written information security program in place. \n",
      "i. Entities that store or maintain PII, PCI, or PHI are required to implement reasonable security to safeguard information in their care. Vendors that do not have a written information security program or resists a contractual agreement requiring one, should be viewed sceptically. \n",
      "ii. Consider requiring vendors of all sizes to conduct periodic penetration testing and/or risk assessments. Although not a requirement, periodic testing and risk assessment is a sign of information security maturity. \n",

The data protection provisions should apply to all vendor personnel, including contractors and subcontractors with access to data. Depending on the relationship, you may want to require that all vendor personnel agree to the data protection provisions in writing.:\n",
      "C. Notification of an Information Security Incident - It is important that the contract require prompt notification in the event of an information security incident involving your data. However, consider the timing and how quickly you will want to be notified. \n",
      "i. Faster is not always better. Forensic investigations take time to understand the full scope of the incident and identify potentially affected individuals. Most legal notification deadlines start from when you are notified by the vendor. If the vendor notifies you immediately, the clock will start running before the vendor has completed their investigation, further reducing the amount of time you have to notify affected individuals. Consider discussing these timing considerations with your legal counsel to find what works best for your organization. \n",
      "ii. Consider requiring the vendor to notify your organization of actual or suspected use, disclosure, or acquisition of your data by an unauthorized actor. \n",
      "1. The vendor may attempt to limit notice obligation only to \"actual\" incidents instead of encompassing \"alleged\" incidents - make sure you include language requiring notification for alleged as well \n",

      "5. Access to Systems\n",
      "The principle of least privilege - only permitting a user to access data or systems that is necessary to perform their duties - is an important data risk management tool for organizations of all sizes. This principle can also be applied to vendors to help limit your exposure in the event of a data security incident. Your organization should consider defining where your data can be stored and what happens after the vendor no longer needs access.:\n",
      "a. Restrictions - Depending on the scope of engagement, you may consider the following restrictions for vendors who access or process your data: \n",
      "i. Domestic Operations: No access or transfer of data to/from outside of the United States (domestic operations); international operations should be subject to the appropriate legal instrument(s) governing access or transfer. \n",
      "ii. No modifications to company data. \n",
      "iii. No unauthorized access. \n",
      "iv. Restrict access to those who \"need to know\" in order to perform services under the agreement. \n",
      "V. Require vendors to terminate credentials of an employee who no longer needs access to your systems to perform their duties. Credential management is a best practice to help limit activity by disgruntled individuals or malicious actors. \n",
      "b. Data Storage - Limiting the data that can be stored outside on your enterprise is an important data loss prevention tool. Consider the following: \n",

This principle can also be applied to vendors to help limit your exposure in the event of a data security incident. Your organization should consider defining where your data can be stored and what happens after the vendor no longer needs access.:\n",
      "i. Limit the data that can be stored outside of your environment to that necessary for a vendor to perform services and authorized by your organization.\n",
      "ii. Do not permit the storage of company data on vendor mobile/removable devices (e.g. laptops, USB drives, or removable) except for limited purpose and duration. \n",
      "C. Data Destruction - Consider requiring that vendors to destroy or securely return your data upon termination or expiration of the engagement. \n",
      "6. Audit Rights \n",
      "Trust, but verify. Depending on the size and nature of your contract, consider requiring vendors to submit to information security audits or questionnaires to ensure compliance with the requirements of the agreement. Below are a few audit considerations for your organization when negotiating vendor contracts. \n",
      "a. Determine who will conduct the audit - vendor, third-party, or resources at your organization. \n",

      "b. Decide on the scope and frequency of the audit as determined by the size and information accessed by the vendor. \n",
      "i. The less onerous the audit measure, the more frequently it can be requested. \n",
      "1. Penetration testing - monthly \n",
      "2. Risk Assessments - quarterly \n",
      "3. Full SOC 2, Type II, or ISO 27001 certification - yearly \n",
      "7. Indemnification and Limitation of Liability \n",
      "Standard limitations on liability are most likely too low to cover the costs related to a breach as breaches often expose companies to significantly high costs for remediation and legal fees. If the vendor had more control over the factors giving rise to a particular risk, the vendor should bear more responsibility in the event that such risk materializes and results in damages to your company. \n",
      "a. Security breaches - Where the vendor is likely responsible, include indemnity language for liability for security breaches and failure to timely notify thereof to vendor; indemnity should cover any breach of confidentiality and security obligations. Depending on who the laws see as the original data owner, you may still have liability and may need to file suit against the vendor to draw upon their insurance policy, should the contractual language not indemnify you to the fullest extent. You should not only require that the vendor indemnify you, but also that the vendor cooperate with any pending litigation or investigation in connection with security incident. \n",

      "i. Insist on exceptions to a limitation of liability cap in instances of gross negligence, wilful misconduct, or fraud and in cases of third-party claims. \n",
      "ii. Limitation of liability provisions should not disclaim the costs of termination and any additional costs you may incur to obtain alternative functionality as promised in the original contract that vendor failed to deliver. \n",
      "iii. Exclude breach of confidentiality, data security, notification and data privacy obligations from the limitation of liability provision to the greatest extent\n",
      "possible. If vendor will not exclude such claims, attempt to negotiate a separate liability cap.:\n",
      "C. Remedies - Limitation of liability provisions should address specific remedies in the event of a breach, including liquidated damages, the right to seek injunctive relief, the right to terminate, credit for not meeting service levels, the release of materials from escrow, breach notification reimbursement, special damages for epidemic failure, etc. \n",
      "d. Impact on Insurance - If you agree to indemnify vendor against third-party claims, consult with your insurance broker to make sure your policy covers the claims and to understand the potential impact of such indemnification language on coverage in general.\n",
      "Document indexed successfully with ID: ajvInpABZY-SBRPURjPD\n",
      "8. Warranties\n",
      "Generally, vendors tend to disclaim all warranties unless specifically stated otherwise. It is therefore crucial to include affirmative, express warranties regarding security. Warranties should be tailored to match the specific services rendered.:\n",
      "a. Require vendor to provide warranties of adequate internal security standards and any such standard that specifically relate to the product acquired or services rendered. \n",
      "b. Require vendor to give ample prior notice of any material changes to the deliverables that could adversely affect security and/or data integrity. \n",
      "C. Vendor should represent that any work product should be free and clear of viruses. \n",
      "d. Vendor should provide proper documentation and/or user manuals describing the deliverable and technical specifications. Work product and all related equipment, software and systems should substantially conform with such documentation. \n",

      "9. Termination\n",
      "The ability to terminate an agreement with a vendor who did not adhere to certain security standards or suffered a breach is essential to the protection of your data. Even if a breach was not involved, the termination of a contract may present additional risk to your company because the vendor may no longer be under any duty to protect your confidential information. Consider the following to award your data maximum protection and to transition the engagement to another provider swiftly and effectively:\n",
      "a. Termination due to a security failure - If termination for convenience cannot be agreed upon, reserve the right to terminate if vendor fails to comply with its security representations and obligations under the agreement (those do not have to amount to a full-blown breach).\n",
      "b. Return of materials upon termination - Vendor should return or destroy all data and materials provided to vendor or created by vendor in the course of the engagement. Sever access to any systems post-termination should be provided for.\n",
      "C. Transition Assistance - Require assistance if data or materials need to be transferred to a subsequent service provider.\n",

      "When engaging a vendor who may use subcontractors to provide the contracted services, your main objective is to hold the vendor to the same performance standards and liabilities regardless of who performs the work. Therefore, the vendor should require any subcontractors to meet the same security standards as vendor is required to meet. Key considerations include the following:\n",
      "a. Vendor should be accountable and liable for any acts or omissions by third parties (such as failure to employ adequate security measures) in accordance with any limitation of liabilities/indemnification provisions in the contract. \n",
      "b. Permission to Subcontract - Vendor should seek prior authorization to subcontract in writing. If vendor will not agree to prior written consent, vendor should at a minimum promptly notify you of any subcontracting. Vendor should not be permitted to subcontract services that access or process sensitive company information. \n",
      "C. Access - Make sure that third-party access rights are spelled out conspicuously to help control who has access to the data and how it can be used when multiple participants are involved.\n",

      "Records, documents, and communications with the vendor may become relevant if litigation is brought against your company due to a security incident. Consider adding language along the lines of the following to ensure in advance that the vendor complies with discovery requests to help avoid friction over this issue in the future.:\n",
      "a. It is beneficial to add language ensuring vendor's compliance with a third-party legal hold notice in the event of litigation, any preservation notices and document requests. \n",
      "b. In instances where the vendor provides software/platform, vendor should allow you to retain an archival copy of the most recently used version of the software and all documentation in the event that discovery requests call for electronically stored information in native format.\n",

The coverages required that respond to these risks are unique and specific to Marine Risks. Note that this chapter is directed at Marine Risks in general but is not intended to address the operations of a major seaport. Once a public entity's Marine Risks are identified a specialist insurance professional or specialist legal counsel should be consulted for drafting appropriate insurance requirements.\n",

      "Water sampling and inspection of underwater facilities\n",
      "All of these types of operations can trigger the need for marine insurance coverage and contractual risk transfer. It is critical to require the appropriate marine insurance policies and endorsements because the standard property and casualty policies (CGL) usually have exclusions that will remove all coverage for the 'wet' marine risks. To address these risks, agreements need to request marine coverages with specific language. The following is a list of the most common coverages and a brief discussion of the coverage:\n",

      "Special Events & Short-Term Rentals\n",
      "Exhibit 12 may be used for both short-term rentals of facilities and for outdoor special events. Note that the specifications also address the issue of liquor liability insurance. As a general rule, any person who is in the business of manufacturing, distributing, or selling alcohol must have liquor liability coverage. This includes a caterer who is supplying alcohol or a non-profit selling beer or wine at a street fair to raise money. These entities should also have a permit issued by the local Alcohol Bureau of Control (ABC) board. Otherwise, if the renter is supplying alcohol for no charge, their coverage should include host liquor liability, and most general liability policies do provide such coverage.\n",

      "Carnival Rides\n",
      "State Fairs are as American as apple pie, and a cornerstone of every fair are the carnival rides. What should be seamless fun for every guest, however, does not occur without proper planning and preparation. The California Division of Occupational Safety and Health (OSHA) has guidelines and requirements for carnival rides. State inspectors are required to inspect all portable amusement rides before they are initially put into operation for public use, and thereafter at least once a year. They must also be inspected upon every disassembly and reassembly. These inspectors are required to report every accident resulting in anything greater than ordinary first aid administration.\n",
      "OSHA further sets specific, yet common, insurance requirements for administration of amusement park rides. However, this regulation applies to permanent rides, which shifts the focus from a pop-up carnival or fair to a formal amusement park, such as Six Flags. OSHA requires the entity to obtain coverage of at least $1,000,000 per occurrence.\n",

      "In addition to coverage for the rides themselves, it's crucial to remember other necessary coverages, including workers' compensation, commercial auto for any transportation or rides or parts, and inland marine for the property while on site, to protect from fire, theft or vandalism.\n",
      "Other related questions which should be addressed prior to opening the carnival include whether this event will generate income, parking responsibilities (your entity or left to the vendors), the desired number of participants and/or spectators, and the entrance fee.\n",

      "Food Trucks/Farmers Markets\n",
      "Food trucks and farmers markets pose similar challenges, as well. Both are short-term operations like carnivals. Food trucks involve inherent mobility, SO in addition to strong general liability and workers' compensation coverage, a sound auto liability and auto physical damage policies are key. There are also many items within the truck vital to food storage, preparation and presentation that should be covered as a loss to any main item, such as an oven or refrigerator, could cause unnecessary delays in that truck's operations.\n",
      "Farmers markets pose inherent risks, too. The entity hosting the farmers market and the vendors themselves require appropriate and comprehensive coverage. Understanding the agreement between the host entity and vendors is crucial, too, SO that each party knows who is responsible for what. The booths need coverage as much as the workers. Most likely, injuries sustained at a farmers' market will be high frequency but low severity, such as slip and falls, illness arising from food, or equipment theft or damage. The host entity may need to protect\n",

      "Contracts Involving Cash/Receipts Handling - Fidelity Bonds & Crime Insurance\n",
      "Separately in this manual, we have discussed use of surety bonds as they relate to construction projects (bid, performance and payment bonds). Historically, another form of surety bond involved \"bonding\" of certain employees or contractors who handle cash. Under these bonds, a loss of cash or securities would be paid to the entity by the surety company which would then seek to recover the funds from the person causing the loss. More recently, the insurance industry has offered \"Crime Insurance Policies\" which include employee dishonesty and theft, disappearance and destruction of money and securities. When an entity is contracting with a third party who will be handling of cash or other forms of receipts, such as credit card transactions, it is important that the entity require a crime insurance policy with limits suitable for amount at risk. For example, a vendor handing parking receipts or fine collections could be handling a significant amount of the entity's funds over the duration of the contract. Suitable risk management controls should be in place to limit the amount of any one loss.\n",

      "This protects parking lot operators who provide valet parking, car dealers, and garage owners against liability for damage to vehicles in their care, custody, or control. The garagekeeper who accepts another's property for repair or keeping becomes a bailee. The law imposes certain legal responsibilities on a bailee. These responsibilities are normally excluded by general liability policies under the care, custody, or control exclusion. Therefore, this coverage is needed. In addition, if the service provider also tows cars to/from servicing locations the insurance should include \"on-hook\" coverage for accidents or damage occurring while a vehicle is in tow.\n",

Standard commercial liability coverage must be endorsed to provide extended coverage for this exposure, including claims of personal injury and violation of civil rights including wrongful detention and discrimination. More likely, a professional service will have a customized package policy for security guards to include these additional coverages. Given the unique nature of these polices we recommend obtaining a copy of the Declarations and confirmation of coverage to include violation of civil rights. We recommend a minimum limit of $3 million for unarmed and $5 million for armed guards. Schools and similar organizations that hire police officers to serve as School Resource Officers should do SO through the officer's agency and confirm the agency is providing coverage for their employee.\n",

      "Of all the types of public entities, entities with an education mission including schools, colleges and universities tend to encompass nearly every type of risk described in this manual. Education operations are SO varied and can include a marine biology field trip (see the Marine chapter), use of a drone (see the Aviation chapter), and computer technology (see the Cyber chapter). Moreover, because in many cases, education risks involve interaction with minors, it is critical that educational organizations contract to protect both the organization and its assets but more importantly, the youth that involved. While the general principles described in this manual are equally applicable to educational organizations, this chapter highlights areas for special attention in these organizations' contracting agreements.\n",

      "Most school campuses are hubs of their communities and there are requirements in some jurisdictions that the facilities be open to use.\n",
      "The usage of on-campus facilities at many educational institutions is about as wide-ranging as any other line of business. From athletic events to fine art exhibitions to book or bake sales, it is almost as common to have outsiders on campus as it is students. When hosting or sponsoring an event on campus, it is recommended that your client fills out a proper application and permit for use of facilities. This agreement should include the applicant's name and purpose, what specific facilities will be used and how, the nature of the event, the date and time range, fees, and estimated attendance - among many other factors. For a more in-depth analysis of such levets, we recommend you read the Special Events Resource Guide, referenced in this Manual in Chapter 7.\n",
      "Document indexed successfully with ID: DTvJnpABZY-SBRPUMzSP\n",
      "Use of Facilities\n",
      "One aspect of allowing third parties to use your facilities that should never be forgotten is the importance of a facilities use agreement that includes insurance requirements similar to the Exhibits in this manual and hold harmless and indemnification agreements, referenced in Appendix C. Additionally, your campus should make the user or other third parties aware of their obligations, both those under your own policies, as well as any mandated by law.

      "Third Party Instructors are analogous to independent contractors. A common example found on school campuses are speech pathologists. They are often hired on a limited basis for a set wage or fee, and many work independently without a parent company. Though they are accredited through a certified organization, they often do not have their own liability coverage, and are typically excluded from standard school general liability policies. A speech pathologist, who often has one- on-one interactions with students behind closed doors to best facilitate a program to the student's needs, is a prime example of a third-party instructor for which your organization needs to secure coverage.\n",

      "A common issue raised against such coverage includes asking why the school should purchase a $10,000 policy when they are only paying the specialist $20,000. In addition to needing coverage since the specialist is likely excluded from the general liability policy, a tailored professional liability insurance policy will provide coverage for the instruction provided, including negligence, defense costs, personal injury, and others. The answer further parallels the secondary consequences raised in a sexual abuse incident. Such specialists should be reminded, too, that in any event of negligence or injury, they just as likely to be personally named in a suit as the school itself.\n",

SAM liability may be endorsed to a standard liability policy or it may be obtained on a specially purchased stand-alone policy. If a contractor attempts to confirm SAM liability coverage by showing their policy does not exclude the exposure (i.e. is silent rather than having an affirmative coverage grant), the authors recommend that the school require written confirmation of coverage from the contractor's insurer or insurance agent/broker. The problem with relying on silence to trigger coverage is that most insurers will decline a claim alleging abuse or molestation based on the intentional acts exclusion and other exclusions for criminal activities. The level of diligence in confirming the coverage may depend on the nature and duration of the contract, but keep in mind that single claimant SAM litigations have cost schools more than $5 million in recent litigation matters.\n",

In addition to the certificate(s), you should require endorsements to the policy for additional insured status on the general liability policy and other requested protection, such as a waiver of subrogation endorsement for Workers' Compensation. For major projects, or to be as certain as possible about coverage and compliance with requirements, you should obtain a copy of the complete insurance policy and read it carefully.\n",

      "A certificate of insurance is a document that gives evidence of the insured's financial ability (via an insurance policy) to respond to a claim. No coverage benefits are afforded to the certificate holder; the certificate merely confirms that the subject company carries insurance.\n",
      "Why are certificates needed?\n",
      "Certificates give evidence that the other party has appropriate insurance to cover the claims for which they are responsible.\n",
      "When are certificates needed?\n",
      "Certificates are needed when another party (such as a contractor janitorial service, security service, etc.) performs services on your behalf or has property in its care, custody, or control (e.g. leasing your premises or your equipment).\n",
      "Who should provide the certificate?\n",
      "The other party's insurance agent, broker, or risk management department should provide the certificate to you, and it should be signed by an authorized representative of the issuer.\n",

      "This certificate or verification of insurance is not an insurance policy and does not amend, extend or alter the coverage afforded by the policies listed herein. Notwithstanding any requirement, term or condition of any contract or other document with respect to which this certificate or verification of insurance may be issued or may pertain, the insurance afforded by the policies described herein is subject to all the terms, exclusions and conditions of such policies.\n",

When these errors on the certificate conflict with terms found in the policy, the policy governs, according to California law. Customized endorsements used by public entities may no longer be accepted by insurers. As a result, asking for an entity's custom endorsements will likely delay the verification of coverage process. The sample custom endorsement may best be used as a baseline to compare what is provided by the contractor rather than a mandatory form.

      "policy that most specifically describes the subject auto is primary and that should be the policy of the vehicle's owner. Taken together, the general rule in California and most other states is that \"the insurance follows the car\", and therefore, there is no need for a separate endorsement. One major exception is for vehicle owners who are in the business of renting, leasing, selling or servicing automobiles. For rental vehicles, the driver's insurance is primary, and unless required by written contract, most garagekeeper's insurance will also be excess over any other insurance available to the driver.\n",
      "As with the additional insured endorsement, the reader is advised to include the primary requirement in their contract specifications and verify the status with an endorsement, policy language, or other written confirmation from the insurer or agent.\n",
      "Waiver of Subrogation - In cases where your entity is an additional insured on the auto and general liability policies and your contract contains a waiver of subrogation, you should not need an endorsement. Most policies, including property insurance, allow their insured to waive subrogation prior to a loss.\n",

      "Other Endorsements\n",
      "A waiver of subrogation should also prevent the contractor's Workers' Compensation insurer from pursuing your entity. However, the standard Workers' Compensation policy form does not allow the insured to waive subrogation. Most insurers will agree to waive subrogation if requested, but many will charge the contractor and additional premium to do SO. Contractors should notify their insurer of the requested waiver of subrogation and obtain their consent. The reader is advised to make sure such notice has been made, and for construction contracts to obtain an endorsement confirming the waiver has been obtained.\n",
      "Waivers Should Be Used with Caution. Some insurance policies void the coverage if the insured agrees to waive the insurer's subrogation rights without prior approval. Other policies permit waivers. You should carefully review the policies and/or call your risk management advisor for assistance when dealing with waivers of subrogation.\n",

When in doubt, or if you are having trouble obtaining the appropriate endorsements, the reader is advised to provide the ISO sample form desired, as an illustration of the requested coverage and as a guide to reviewing any customized endorsements provided by the insurer. The reader is advised to review any customized endorsements very carefully, as they will often provide less than the recommended coverage.

      "APPENDIX C: Sample Hold Harmless Agreements\n",
      "The second step in the process of contractual risk transfer outlined in this manual is to use good hold harmless language to provide your entity the broadest protection possible in the event of a claim or suit arising from the contractor's services, work product, or activities. Hold harmless language should be included in all types of agreements, including permits, purchase orders, and leases. As used in this section \"hold harmless\" agreements typically include agreements to \"hold harmless, defend and indemnify\" with each of these three terms having a distinct legal meaning. Also, we have provided here some analysis of California statutes, and these may be similar to other jurisdictions but should be reviewed in the context of each state's laws and regulations.\n",
      "In contract, the language that transfers the risk from one organization to another is commonly referred to as the hold harmless clause. Note that a hold harmless clause may also be referred to as an indemnification clause. This clause should specifically spell out the responsibilities of your entity and the contractor. It will identify which types of losses the parties to the agreement will be responsible for.\n",
      "Document indexed successfully with ID: JjvKnpABZY-SBRPUszWv\n",
      "Often times, the hold harmless language will be a \"mutual hold harmless\" clause which is a frequent practice when two or more public agencies are signatories to agreements. There is a genuine need for caution with this type of \"mutual hold harmless\" since they may cancel each other out and provide no protection for either Entity. If the scope of the hold harmless is not specified for each Entity and they cancel each other out, the attorneys for the carriers involved will regard the opposing party without the good will the original drafters had in mind when they adopted the \"mutual hold harmless\" language.\n",
      "This practice is not recommended when you are contracting with private organizations and the agreements should require contractors to assume all of the liability imposed by the actions of the agreements to the extent possible. This type of liability transfer will generally be recognized and upheld in the legal system as long as the inherent risk transferred is commensurate with the compensation to the contractor. We strongly recommend that legal, risk management, and other disciplines within your organization collaborate to create hold harmless agreements that are acceptable to your entity.\n",
      "Document indexed successfully with ID: JzvKnpABZY-SBRPUtTV_\n",
      "The following hold-harmless agreement wordings are provided as examples only. Innumerable alternatives to these forms are possible, each alternative having a different purpose depending on the wishes of the parties. Drafting hold harmless language in contracts is a crucial part of the risk transfer process and should not be undertaken without the advice and assistance of legal counsel.\n",
      "Indemnity and hold harmless provisions are regulated by the California Civil Code and case law interpreting the Code sections. Under CA Civil Code Section 1668,\n",
      "All contracts which have for their object, directly or indirectly, to exempt anyone from responsibility for his own fraud, or willful injury to the person or property of another, or violation of law, whether willful or negligent, are against the policy of the law.\n",

      "Section 2782.1 makes an exception where the contract is not being performed for the public agency, but the public agency as an accommodation allows the contractor to enter upon its property or adjacent to its property. Section 2782.2 permits the owner of a project to indemnify a professional engineer if certain conditions are met. Section 2782.5 permits parties to a construction contract to negotiate and expressly agree with respect to the allocation, release, liquidation, exclusion, or limitation as between the parties of any liability (a) for design defects, or (b) of the promisee to the promisor arising out of or relating to the construction contract.\n",

(However, some cases indicate that the intent of the parties controls the case regardless of these classification cases). Section 2782.8 was amended as of January 1, 2018 and declares unenforceable all contracts under which a public agency seeks indemnity from specified professionals, unless the underlying claim arises out of negligence, recklessness or willful misconduct of the design professional. Effective January 1, 2009, California added 2782.9. Subsection (a) states\n",

      "Contractor shall hold harmless, defend and indemnify Entity and its officers, officials, employees and volunteers from and against any and all liability, loss, damage, expense, costs (including without limitation costs and fees of litigation) of every nature arising out of or in connection with Contractor's performance of work hereunder or its failure to comply with any of its obligations contained in the agreement, except such loss or damage which was caused by the sole negligence or willful misconduct of the Entity.\n",
      "The contractor promises your Entity to assume all risk of loss resulting from the project, including losses caused by the joint negligence of your Entity and the contractor or its subcontractors. The only exceptions are for your sole negligence or willful acts.\n",
      "Caution regarding Type 1: While this type of agreement provides the broadest protection for the Entity, it is no longer allowed in a construction related contract (defined in CA Civil Code Section 2783), after January 1, 2013. Example 2 (below) should be used instead.\n",

      "In this second example, the Entity receives indemnification if it was not negligent or if its negligence was only passive. There is a great deal of case law on the active/passive distinction, but essentially active negligence is affirmative participation in causing the harm, or failure to prevent a known danger. Conversely, passive negligence is failure to detect a danger which the Entity is under a duty to detect, such as a dangerous condition on its property created by the contractor.\n",

      "There is great variety of language used to arrive at this type of intermediate form because any indemnity contract which does not specifically refer to the indemnitee's negligence will be construed as this type of general clause, not providing indemnity for active negligence. So, if the contract promises indemnity for losses, however caused, regardless of responsibility for negligence, arising from use of the premises, facilities or services, or caused by any person or persons, the wording will be interpreted as a general indemnity clause and would be void and unenforceable.

      "A significant restriction for public entity contracts with \"Design Professionals\" CA Civil Code $2782.8 became effective as of January 1, 2007, and limits the indemnity language a public agency may use by stating:\n",

However [if] one or more defendant is unable to pay its share of defense costs due to bankruptcy or dissolution of the business, the design professional shall meet and confer with other parties regarding unpaid defense costs. The duty to indemnify, including the duty and the cost to defend, is limited as provided in this section. This section shall not be waived or modified by contractual agreement, act, or omission of the parties.\"\n",
      "The main concern raised by the amendment relates to the proportionate percentage of fault attributed to the design professional. Such determination is made by a combination of adjusters, attorneys, insurers, mediators and ultimately the courts.

      "Another issue is whether payment of such legal fees occurs at the outset of litigation, or after litigation has been concluded. Because this section was amended as of January 1, 2018, it will likely be some time before courts reach conclusions on its interpretation. The lack of case law and corresponding unknowns regarding issues under this code make it nearly impossible to know who will be responsible for what defense costs and at what point(s) in litigation. Contractors may be required to pay defense costs at the outset and thus pay more than their proportionate share, to use statutory language, resulting in necessary reimbursement from the public entity. Conversely, the design professional likely accepts responsibility negating the public entity's obligation to front defense costs and hope for reimbursement afterwards.\n",
      "Because case law and statutory interpretation are understandably silent, initial negotiations regarding such payments and their timing are of the utmost importance. Though the statute clearly states design professionals have a duty to defend proportionate to their level of fault, the parties are left to determine the rest.\n",

There are three generally recognized forms of indemnification provisions-broad form, intermediate form, and limited form.

On the other hand, under \"partial\" intermediate indemnification provisions, the indemnitor assumes the loss payment obligation only to the extent of the indemnitor's fault. Thus, for instance, if the indemnitor is fifty percent at fault, it has an obligation to pay for fifty percent of the loss. Full intermediate indemnification provisions are widely prohibited, while partial intermediate indemnification provisions are typically permissible.\n",
      "Finally, limited form indemnification provisions are permitted under the law of any state. Under limited form provisions, the indemnitor assumes the loss payment obligation only if it is solely at fault In other words, the indemnitor is not liable to the indemnitee if the indemnitee is even partially at fault\n",

      "Sales and marketing costs include advertising and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, including sales commissions related to AWS. We direct customers to our stores primarily through a number of marketing channels, such as our sponsored search, social and online advertising, third-party customer referrals, television advertising, and other initiatives. Our marketing costs are largely variable, based on growth in sales and changes in rates. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing costs.\n",
      "The increase in sales and marketing costs in absolute dollars in 2023, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities.\n",
      "While costs associated with Amazon Prime membership benefits and other shipping offers are not included in sales and marketing expense, we view these offers as effective worldwide marketing tools, and intend to continue offering them indefinitely.\n",

      "Legal Proceedings\n",
      "In December 2018, Kove IO, Inc. filed a complaint against Amazon Web Services, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The complaint alleges, among other things, that Amazon S3 and DynamoDB infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 7,814,170 and 7,103,640, each entitled \"Network Distributed Tracking Wire Transfer Protocol\"; and 7,233,978, entitled \"Method and Apparatus for Managing Location Information in a Network Separate from the Data to Which the Location Information Pertains.\" The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages, enhanced damages, attorneys' fees, costs, interest, and injunctive relief. In March 2022, the case was stayed pending resolution of review petitions we filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. In November 2022, the stay was lifted. In July 2023, Kove alleged in its damages report that in the event of a finding of liability Amazon Web Services could be subject to $517 million to $1.03 billion in damages. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.\n",

Additionally, sales by our sellers have higher payment processing and related transaction costs as a percentage of net sales compared to our retail sales because payment processing costs are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions.\n",

We are not the seller of record in these transactions. The commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping fees we earn from these arrangements are recognized when the services are rendered, which generally occurs upon delivery of the related products to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an Amazon delivery, to the customer.\n",
      "Advertising services - We provide advertising services to sellers, vendors, publishers, authors, and others, through programs such as sponsored ads, display, and video advertising. Revenue is recognized as ads are delivered based on the number of clicks or impressions.\n",
      "Subscription services - Our subscription sales include fees associated with Amazon Prime memberships and access to content including digital video, audiobooks, digital music, e-books, and other non-AWS subscription services. Prime memberships provide our customers with access to an evolving suite of benefits that represent a single stand-ready obligation. Subscriptions are paid for at the time of or in advance of delivering the services. Revenue from such arrangements is recognized over the subscription period.\n",
