If you have questions that are not answered by this section, please do not hesitate to contact your Alliant Account Administrator. As you can see by reviewing the following section, we all learn through the process of thoughtfully examining the risk management process.", "<list>1. If a lessee or contractor is a large one, do I still need to insist on the insurance requirements? \nYes; you normally have no way of verifying that their assets are sufficient for losses that might occur, whereas you could be confident in an insurance carrier with a quality A.M. Best Rating. \n2. Is it all right if the contractor alters the indemnification language? \nThis is not advised. Indemnification language is carefully worded to afford your Entity as much protection as legally possible, and usually the exact language has been tested in court. Altering the language could weaken your Entity's protection and should only be undertaken on advice of your legal counsel. \n3. Can we require an A.M. Best rating for a company that is \"admitted\" in California, or is this against the law? \nYes; unless the company is providing a surety bond. State law requires owners to accept surety bonds from any surety company, in an effort to improve small firm contractors' chances in successfully bidding a job. If it is a federally approved surety company, you are obligated to accept the surety company. This can be reviewed on the web at: \nhttps://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/ \nRemember, just because an insurance company is \"admitted\" does not ensure that they have the financial strength designation required by your contract. Also, we have removed the requirement for \"admitted\" insurers because SO much insurance is now written by Surplus Lines insurers. We now suggest that insurers be \"authorized\" to write business in the state and rated by A. M. Best. These companies can offer advanced forms that can be tailored to specific needs. However, carefully verify that they do not take away needed standard coverages! \n4. Why should we ask for property insurance on tenants' improvements and betterments, instead of just adding them to our property insurance policy? \nUnless the lease specifically states that your Entity gains ownership of these improvements as soon as they are installed, your Entity has no insurable interest in them; and, therefore, you usually cannot insure them under your policy. We recommend that you require tenants to insure their TIB's and personal property. If your entity does have an insurable interest, you may want to add the TIB's to your entity's property insurance. \n5. If the contractor's insurance does not meet the criteria in our insurance requirement specifications, should we alter the requirements to fit the contractor's insurance? \nNo; the insurance requirements language has been carefully worded to afford your Entity as much protection as possible, and it has been tested in court. Altering the language would usually weaken your Entity's protection. It is not the responsibility of your Entity to tailor your requirements to what the contractor has; rather, the contractor should procure insurance to meet</list>", "<table>|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n</table>", "<list>your specifications and truly, you are doing the contractor a favor in showing it the proper coverage needed in order to protect its business. We have worked very hard to recommend insurance requirement specifications that not only protect the Entity but are also realistic and available in the marketplace for the Contractor. \n6. Does the \"edition date\" on the suggested ISO endorsements matter? \nYes; there have been significant reductions in the coverage afforded to additional insureds by \"updated\" versions of these endorsements. A further discussion regarding these changes is contained in the section of this manual describing these endorsements. \n7. If the agent or broker changes the word \"endeavor\" to \"will provide\" in the notification of cancellation section of the certificate of insurance, or says we don't need an endorsement because of language on the certificate, are we okay? \nNo; Certificates of insurance DO NOT alter the insurance coverage, and any changes that are necessary need to be endorsed onto the policy with a copy of the endorsement provided to your Entity. Agents and brokers will sometimes try to convince you that endorsements are unnecessary when the certificate has its standard wording changed; if so, you need to point out the boxes across the top of the certificate, one which states that it confers no rights on the holder and DOES NOT amend or alter the insurance and the other that endorsements are needed for additional insured status and may be needed for waiver of subrogation. \nTo ensure that the burden is on the insurance company to notify you of a change in status of coverage, you must receive an endorsement to this effect. Some carriers will provide such an endorsement, especially for larger projects, but most do not. Being named as an \"additional insured\" does NOT obligate the insurer to inform you of any status change in the policy since most policies require only the First Named Insured be notified. \nPrior editions of this manual have suggested requiring notice of cancellation or coverage changes with 30 days' notice by USPS registered mail with a return receipt. This approach does not seem feasible in the current environment of electronic communications and express mail services. Moreover, some insurers refuse to take on this obligation and, in some states, the cancellation requirements are stronger. \nMany risk managers are now requiring that the contractor take on this responsibility. While this may be allowing the \"fox to guard the henhouse\", mid-term cancellations and reductions of coverage are SO rare as to make the value of this term less important. If a contract involves a risk SO substantial that the risk of cancellation or coverage reduction is heightened, a project specific policy with the Entity as an Additional Insured may be warranted. \nNOTE: The latest edition of the standard certificate of insurance form now reads that \"notice of cancellation will be provided in accordance with policy terms and conditions.\" This does not confer special rights on additional insureds and you must ask for an endorsement to the policy if your entity truly desires advance notice of cancellation. \n"], "1": ["<title>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS </title>", "The following questions represent those most often asked by users of this manual.

This can be reviewed on the web at: \nhttps://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/ \nRemember, just because an insurance company is \"admitted\" does not ensure that they have the financial strength designation required by your contract. Also, we have removed the requirement for \"admitted\" insurers because SO much insurance is now written by Surplus Lines insurers.

Why should we ask for property insurance on tenants' improvements and betterments, instead of just adding them to our property insurance policy? \nUnless the lease specifically states that your Entity gains ownership of these improvements as soon as they are installed, your Entity has no insurable interest in them; and, therefore, you usually cannot insure them under your policy. We recommend that you require tenants to insure their TIB's and personal property. If your entity does have an insurable interest, you may want to add the TIB's to your entity's property insurance. \n5. If the contractor's insurance does not meet the criteria in our insurance requirement specifications, should we alter the requirements to fit the contractor's insurance? \nNo; the insurance requirements language has been carefully worded to afford your Entity as much protection as possible, and it has been tested in court.

A further discussion regarding these changes is contained in the section of this manual describing these endorsements. \n7. If the agent or broker changes the word \"endeavor\" to \"will provide\" in the notification of cancellation section of the certificate of insurance, or says we don't need an endorsement because of language on the certificate, are we okay? \nNo; Certificates of insurance DO NOT alter the insurance coverage, and any changes that are necessary need to be endorsed onto the policy with a copy of the endorsement provided to your Entity. Agents and brokers will sometimes try to convince you that endorsements are unnecessary when the certificate has its standard wording changed; if so, you need to point out the boxes across the top of the certificate, one which states that it confers no rights on the holder and DOES NOT amend or alter the insurance and the other that endorsements are needed for additional insured status and may be needed for waiver of subrogation. \nTo ensure that the burden is on the insurance company to notify you of a change in status of coverage, you must receive an endorsement to this effect.

If it is only physical work, then a liability policy, general and/or automobile will most likely cover all your exposures to loss.", "However, if the work or a portion of the work is expected to involve the use of professional knowledge, professional liability insurance is required.", "As an example, if a contractor is merely following blueprints in constructing a building, it would involve only physical work and a general liability policy will suffice. However, if the contractor is a \"design-build\" firm, or decides that it knows of a better way to construct part of the building, and it alters the blueprints accordingly, then it has crossed the line over into providing \"professional\" service and would then need professional liability coverage to cover a subsequent loss."], "15": ["<header>16. How long of a period of time do we require the claims-made professional liability insurance to be carried after completion of the project? </header>", "A \"claims-made\" coverage will only respond to a claim that is presented while the policy is in force or during an extended reporting provision. Therefore, it is imperative that your Entity be protected as long as possible after the completion of the project, SO that any claims caused by faulty design or other professional services (see Question 15) will be covered by the responsible party. Keep in mind your regular general liability policy will not cover professional liability losses, and therefore your contractor may be bare in the event of a claim arising out of professional services rendered on the project. Normally, professional liability policies can be purchased with a three year \"tail\" (reporting period), which will allow claims to be presented up to three years after the professional liability policy expires. If you can get a longer tail in your contract, do SO."], "16": ["<header>17. Does a contractor need proof of automobile liability when hired to work on the premises? </header>", "Yes; for the simple reason that the contractor has to use some means of transportation to reach your premises, and to transport tools, supplies, and materials. If the contractor is determined to be engaged in business on your Entity's behalf when it is involved in an automobile accident, then your Entity may be held liable. Further, since owners of vehicles are required to carry insurance anyway, this requirement carries little burden to the contractor."], "17": ["<header>18. Should we ask to be named as an additional insured on the contractor's professional liability policy? </header>", "No; the contractor's professional liability insurer will not comply with such a request. The reason is that the insurer does not want to pick up your Entity's professional liability hazards, which it would do if you were an additional insured. Professional liability policies are specifically underwritten based on the professional history of the contractor. A contractor's insurer is not interested in underwriting your Entity's professional risk, and therefore will not add your Entity as an additional insured on the contractor's policy."], "18": ["<header>19. What can be done if we don't have the proof of insurance when it is time to start the work? </header>", "There is very little that can be done at this point in the process, which is why we strongly recommend that the indemnity and insurance specifications be sent out with the pre-bid package.

How can you tell if the organization can fund their SIR? We recommend reviewing the financial statement to see whether it appears the organization has the revenues and assets to pay for its SIR. If the organization is private, we recommend asking for the most recent audited financial statement (noting that you may be required to sign a non-disclosure agreement). For a construction contract, we recommend very careful examination of an SIR larger than $250,000.00 and that large an SIR should only be proposed on a very large capital project. Other vendors such as major utilities or Fortune 500 companies may have an appropriate SIR running in the millions of dollars. \nFunding of SIR - A well-funded self-insurance program should be able to demonstrate funding of the SIR at a reasonable level. For a smaller SIR, it may not be necessary to ask for a copy of a recent actuarial study (and they may not have one, say for a $100,000.00 SIR). For a larger SIR, you should obtain more information, and at least a certification by</list>", "a risk professional (such as the organization's Risk Manager) that the program has been funded at a 70% confidence level or more as calculated by an independent actuary. You may find information on funding in an audited financial statement.", "<list>Program Management - A self-insurance program requires that the insured is responsible for administration of the claims within the SIR. This may be performed in-house or by a third-party-administrator (TPA). You should evaluate whether the contractor has the resources and personnel to administer claims, or whether their TPA is reputable. \nExcess/Reinsurer Review - The number of insurers offering SIR Policies is relatively small. SIR Policies are considered \"specialty\" contracts and are carefully underwritten by \"specialty\" underwriters. As a result, you would normally expect to see an SIR policy issued by a larger \"A\" rated carrier - a minimum of size X in our opinion for the lead (first excess layer) underwriter.</list>", "As you can see, there is not an exact science to evaluating an SIR. We recommend engaging your insurance broker or other risk management advisor to assist in your evaluation of an SIR for the first few times you encounter an SIR.

The higher limit is appropriate for general contractors on any new construction or major remodel projects.

Please refer to the chart in Appendix D, for a reference to suggested minimum limits for a variety of construction and other risks. \nExtended Coverage and Additional Insured Status \nFor many types of construction projects, the reader is advised to consider requiring that the contractor maintain general liability coverage and maintain your entity's status as an additional insured for a period of time after completion. This is due to the fact that defects in construction may not become evident or cause damage for many years after completion, and you want to be certain the contractor has coverage naming you as an additional insured when that damage first occurs. \nFor example, your entity hires a contractor to replace a sewer line. Four years later, neighboring homeowners file a claim alleging negligent construction of the line has caused their patios to shift and crack. The contractor's policy at the time the damages first began, say three years after construction and a heavy rain, is the first policy to respond to the loss. While your entity may be able to rely on the hold harmless agreement, and the contractor may have insurance at that time, you will not have the added protection of additional insured status. \nNote: For new and larger construction projects, requesting coverage for up to 5 to 7 years, or even longer, is recommended.
